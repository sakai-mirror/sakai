    <h3><a name="Coding Standards">Coding Standards</a></h3>
    <p>
This document describes a list of coding conventions that are required
for code submissions to the project. By default, the coding conventions
for most Open Source Projects should follow the existing coding conventions
in the code that you are working on. For example, if the bracket is on
a new line, then you should write all your code
to use that same convention.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you commit code that does not follow these conventions, you
are responsible for also fixing your own code.</strong>

</p>
<p>
Below is a list of coding conventions that are specific to Navigo,
everything else not specifically mentioned here should follow the official
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">Sun
Java Coding Conventions</a> <i>and</i> 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521777682/">The Elements of Java Style</a> (ISBN: 0521777682).
</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Brackets should begin and end on a new line and should exist even
for one line statements. Examples: </li>
    </ol>
<div id="source" class="source">
    <pre>
if(foo)
{
    // code here
}

try
{
    // code here
}
catch(Exception bar)
{
    // code here
}
finally
{
    // code here
}

while(true)
{
    // code here
}
</pre>
</div>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>Though it's considered acceptable to include spaces inside parentheses, the 
preference is to not include them. </li>
    </ol>
<div id="source" class="source">
    <pre>
if(foo)    // preferred

or

if ( foo ) // acceptable
</pre>
</div>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>2 space indent. <u><strong>NO tabs</strong></u>
. Period. We understand
that many developers like to use tabs, but the fact of the matter is
that in a distributed development environment where diffs are sent to
the mailing lists by both developers and the version control system
(which sends commit log messages), the use of tabs makes it impossible to
preserve legibility. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Unix linefeeds for all .java source code files.&nbsp; Please set your 
      editor appropriately. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>JavaDoc <strong>MUST</strong>
 exist on all methods.  If your code
modifications use an existing class/method/variable which lacks
JavaDoc, it is required that you add it.  This will improve the
project as a whole. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The Navigo License <strong>MUST</strong>
 be placed at the top
of each and every file.
<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>If you contribute to a file (code or documentation), add yourself to 
      the authors list at the top of the file.&nbsp; The class or interface 
      creator should be listed first.&nbsp; For java files the 
preferred Javadoc format is: </li>

      <li>Log4j logging statements should be included as classes are built and 
      not as an afterthought.&nbsp; Once the application is moved into 
      production, the output from log4j will be the <b>primary</b> 
      troubleshooting and debugging method.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Junit units tests should be written along with classes and not as an 
      afterthought.&nbsp; These tests should be integrated in a test suite which 
      will be performed and evaluated during each major and minor release.&nbsp; 
      These junit tests should map very closely back to requirements gathered in 
      UML documentation.<br>
&nbsp;</li>

      version control.</li>

      <li>UML will be used to document the requirements of the application.&nbsp; 
      Functionality will not be added to the application without corresponding 
      UML documentation.</li>
      <li>UML documentation should include detailed Use Case and Class Diagrams 
      at a minimum.&nbsp; Inclusion of activity diagrams is preferred.</li>
      <li>The application will be comprised of three distinct tiers: Data, 
      Business, and Presentation.&nbsp; Classes should be designed to fit neatly 
      into one of these layers.</li>
