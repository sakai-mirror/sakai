<h2>Sakai 2.0 Admin: Overview
</h2>
<h3>What they do</h3>

<p>The Admin tools allow system administrators (i.e., users with admin
accounts) to create, delete, and administer course site or
project site settings. Users with admin accounts will see
these tools from their My Workspace.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>System administrators have access to tools to which regular users do
not, such as the Users tool and the Sites tool. The admin also has
privileges and permissions not available to any other user. For
example, the admin can see and edit all sites.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>When the application is first installed, the admin is the only
pre-installed account, and is able to create worksites.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>The My Workspace template site is the site with the siteID
<code>!user</code>. Admins can edit this site to include or exclude
whatever tools they wish to display in their users' My Workspaces. All
users are assigned the "maintain" role in their respective My
Workspaces, which gives them edit control over that section.

</li>
</ul>
