<h2>Sakai 2.0 Permissions and Roles: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What they do</h3>

<p>Permissions allow users to access certain features of a course or
project worksite, depending on their roles and on the decisions made
by the site maintainer and the system administrator.</p>

<p>When you create a worksite or when one is created for you, you as
the maintainer of that site can choose (within the limits established
by the system administrator) which tools or functions (e.g.,
Discussion, Schedule, Resources) you want the site to have. For each
of these tools or functions, you can set permissions that allow or
prevent users from seeing or performing certain tasks depending on
their roles.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>Roles may vary in name depending on the application
implementation. However, in general, the "maintain" role (or its
equivalent) has full administrative permission to create, edit, and
delete within a worksite. The "access" role has fewer permissions, and
cannot create content or delete in all tools. For example, by default
the access role cannot upload files into Resources, but can create
Chat messages and Discussion replies.</p>

<p>Roles are given default permissions. However, someone with maintain
rights can change the permissions for different roles to suit the
site's needs.</p>

<h3>Things to remember</h3>

<ul>
<li>The availability of a tool in a worksite depends upon the
particular implementation of the system administrator. If you have
maintain rights to a worksite and find that a tool is not available
through Worksite Setup, consult your administrator.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Default roles have default permissions; however, these defaults
can be edited on the system level by the system administrator and on
the worksite level by anyone with maintain rights to the site.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>All users are assigned the maintain role in their respective My
Workspaces; this gives a user edit control over his or her My
Workspace.
</li>
</ul>
