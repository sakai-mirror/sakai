<h2>In Sakai 2.0, how do I export assignment grades to a spreadsheet?
</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This may not be available in your implementation of this application.</p>

<p>To export grades from the Assignments tool to a spreadsheet, follow
these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project
site, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>Next to the list of assignments, click <strong><code>Grade</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Near the top of the page, click <strong><code>Grade Report</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Download Spreadsheet</code></strong>.
<br><br>
</li>

<li>Depending on your web browser, you might be prompted to either
open the file or save it. Follow your web browser's prompts; if you
choose to save the file, you will have to locate it (e.g., on your
computer's hard drive) to open the spreadsheet.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The downloaded file will be in Microsoft Excel
(i.e., <code>.xls</code>) format.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In the spreadsheet, the first column will list all of the students
with grades for assignments. Each subsequent column will list a
different assignment, and student grades will be located in the
corresponding cells in each column.</p>
