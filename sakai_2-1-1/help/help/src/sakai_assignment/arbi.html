<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I add the Honor Pledge
to an assignment?
</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For general information on creating an
assignment, see Creating/adding, editing, or deleting an assignment or Posting an assignment previously saved as a draft.</p>

<p>The Honor Pledge requires students to affirm that they have neither
given nor received aid on an assignment. Students must click a
checkbox pledging this in order to submit the assignment.</p>

<p>To add the Honor Pledge to your assignment, near the bottom of the
assignment screen, check the <strong><code>Add honor pledge</code></strong> checkbox. You
may add the Honor Pledge to a new assignment or to one that you are
revising.</p>
