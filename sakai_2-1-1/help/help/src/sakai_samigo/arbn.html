<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I
take an assessment?
</h2>

<p>To take an assessment, in the menubar of the course
site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>. Under "Take an assessment", you will see a
list of available assessments. Click an assessment's title to see
information about the assessment, such as the date due, whether or not
there is a time limit, and whether or not the assessment will
automatically be submitted if the time limit expires. Click <strong><code>Begin
Assessment</code></strong> to take the assessment, or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort.</p>

<p>Depending on how the assessment has been set up, you may have the
option during the assessment to save your work and continue, to submit
it, and to return to previous sections or questions. When you click
<strong><code>Submit for Grading</code></strong>, you will receive a confirmation number
that you should keep.</p>
