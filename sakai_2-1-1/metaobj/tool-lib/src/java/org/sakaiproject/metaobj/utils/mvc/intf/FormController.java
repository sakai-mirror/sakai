/**
 * This controller is useful for handling form submissions.  In a normal form submission
 * formBackingObject is called to create the backing object.  Next the system binds
 * request params into this object, and performs validation.  If validation errors are
 * detected the system re-renders the form view.  This flow creates a problem if you need
 * to populate the model with something for the form, because if you try to do this
 * work in formBackingObject, you notice the system doesn't call this again in the case
 * of validation erros.  The referenceData methods provides an convenient place to do this
 * work.  This method will be called before rendering the form the first time, and before
 * rendering the form after validation errors.
