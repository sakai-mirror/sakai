<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how can I print my calendar?
</h2>
	  
<p>To create an Adobe PDF file of your calendar that you may
use to print, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar of your My Workspaceor the
course or project site whose calendar you wish to print,
click <strong><code>Schedule</code></strong>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All calendar entries for sites you have
access to are automatically merged into your My Workspace Schedule, so
it's likely the one that you'll want to print.</p>
</li>
<li>From the "View:" drop-down list, select the desired view for the
calendar to be printed (e.g., <strong><code>Calendar by Week</code></strong> or <strong><code>Calendar
by Month</code></strong>).  <br><br>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Printable Version</code></strong>. This will open a new window with
the calendar as a PDF document. From this window, choose whichever
printing method your browser offers to print the calendar
(e.g., a printer icon).</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have no weekend calendar entries and
you select the <strong><code>Calendar by Week</code></strong> view, the week printed will
be Monday through Friday.</p>
