<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I give an assessment?
</h2>
	  <p>In order to give an assessment, you must first publish it. Once it's
published, your assessment's availability depends on how you've
configured certain settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>The assessment will be available only during the time frame you
specified in the "Delivery Dates" setting.<br><br>
</li>
<li>It will be accessible by only those people or groups you specified
in the "Assessment released to:" setting.<br><br>
</li>

<li>If you listed specific IP addresses in the "High
Security" setting, only people connecting from those computers will be
able to access your assessment.<br><br>
</li>
<li>If you created a secondary username and password in the "High
Security" setting, people will need to authenticate with
that username and password to gain access.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Students in courses or sections to which you granted access in the
"Assessments released to" setting can navigate to the assessment from
within the application. After logging in and selecting the appropriate
course, they should click <strong><code>Tests &amp; Quizzes</code></strong>. From the
resulting page, they can begin taking an assessment by clicking its
title.</p>

<p>Other users to whom you've granted access can use the
URL that you received when you published your
assessment. You can distribute the URL to those individuals in any way
you like, but remember to consider the available, due, and retract
dates you specified in the assessment's "Delivery Dates" setting.
  If you selected
<strong><code>Anonymous</code></strong>, then anyone with the URL can take your assessment.
