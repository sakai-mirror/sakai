<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I access files in
Mac OS X using WebDAV?
</h2>
	  
WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows
users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers.

<h3>Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)</h3>

<p>
To use WebDAV to access files in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), follow
these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Finder, press <code>Cmd-k&#160;</code>. (Alternatively,
from the <strong><code>Go</code></strong> menu, choose <strong><code>Connect to Server</code></strong>.)

<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the "Server Address:" field, enter the appropriate text:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>If you know the correct URL, you can connect to your personal resource
space by entering it into the "Internet or network address"
field. Contact your site administrator for the URL's format; it will
likely include your username.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Similarly, you can connect to the Resources for a specific course,
  and upload and download files to and from Resources, if you know the
  correct URL and the unique site ID number. The ID number is the sequence of
  numbers appearing immediately at the end of your site's URL. For
  example, once you have clicked the tab for a particular site, the
  URL field in your web browser will contain something similar to
  this: 
 https://oncoursecl.iu.edu/portal/site/123456789-123

<p>The site ID in this case would be <code>123456789-123</code>. To
  save a site ID number, while you are in the site, click
  <strong><code>File</code></strong>, then either <strong><code>Save as...</code></strong> or <strong><code>Save page
  as...&#160;</code></strong>. Make sure the site ID number is in the "File
  name:" field, and then save it to a place where you can easily
  retrieve it.  </p>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Optionally, you may click the <strong><code>+</code></strong> (plus sign) to the right
of the server address after you enter it, and the server will be added
to your list of favorite servers.

<p>
When you log in, you can choose to have the password remembered in
your Keychain. If you do this, you will not be prompted for a
password when you log into your personal Resources or the Resources
for any site to which you have access. Do not do this unless your
computer is secured from use by others.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

You may now drag and drop folders between your hard drive and the
Resources to which you just connected.
</p>

<h3>Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and earlier</h3>

<p>Using WebDAV to access files in Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and earlier
requires a third-party client called Goliath. You can download a free
copy of Goliath from:</p>

<a href="http://www.webdav.org/goliath/installs/Goliath1_0_1.dmg.gz">http://www.webdav.org/goliath/installs/Goliath1_0_1.dmg.gz</a>

<ol>
<li>Once you have downloaded the file, double-click it to decompress
it. Then, double-click the resulting <code>.dmg</code> file.  A disk
image named <code>Goliath 1.0.1</code> should now be available.

<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Drag and drop the Goliath folder contained within the disk image
to your hard disk.
<br>
<br> 
</li>
<li>Open the Goliath application and follow the appropriate
instructions below:
<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>If you know the correct URL, you can connect to your personal resource
space by entering it into the "Internet or network address"
field. Contact your site administrator for the URL's format; it will
likely include your username.

<br><br>
</li>

</li>
</ul>

<br>
</li>
<li>The first time you attempt to connect, you may be prompted to
accept a certificate for the site. Click <strong><code>OK</code></strong> if prompted.</li>
</ol>
