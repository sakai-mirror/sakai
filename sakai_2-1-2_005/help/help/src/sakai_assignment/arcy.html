site, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>.

(followed by the date and time at which the assignment was returned)
in the "Status" column of the Assignments table.</p>

submission. Your instructor may have included comments in the text of
your original submission, and any additional comments from your
instructor will appear near the bottom of the page. In the box labeled
"Enter below for resubmission", edit or paste your revised submission
for the assignment.
