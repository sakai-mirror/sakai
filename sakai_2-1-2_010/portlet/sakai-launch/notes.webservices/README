This contains two web services that are needed:

SakaiPortalLogin.jws - This is already present in Sakai 2.1
SakaiSite.jws - This was not in the 2.1 release - hopefully it will be in the 2.1.1 release.

If you check out from trunk, these files are there.

Replace these two files in the following spot in Sakai source:

~/dev/sakai/webservices/axis/src/webapp

You can always put them directly in 

~/dev/tomcat/webapps/sakai-axis/

But then they will get wiped out after a re-deploy of webservices from source.
