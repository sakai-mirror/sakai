<h2>Overriding an autocalculated course grade</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this document,
you need to be assigned a role that has the necessary permissions.</p>

<p>The Gradebook automatically calculates a course grade that's a
percentage of current points scored out of the total points possible
for all assignments. Therefore, the autocalculated course grade can be
accurate only when all assignments are graded. If ungraded assignments
are present, they will count as 0 points scored, and the resulting
course grade will not accurately reflect the student's cumulative
score.</p>

<p>By default, the option for displaying a course grade is disabled,
and students see only their cumulative scores and the scores for each
of their assignments. To display a course grade to students, click
<strong><code>Grade Options</code></strong>, place a checkmark in the box next to "Display
course grades to students now", and then click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.</p>

<p>To override the autocalculated course grade, and enter a grade to
display that reflects a student's true running course grade, follow
these steps:</p>

<ol id="id44829600">
<li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>. If you are
not already on the Overview page of the Gradebook tool, click
<strong><code>Overview</code></strong> near the top of the window.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>At the bottom of the assignment list, click <strong><code>Course Grade</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>On the resulting page, you will see a list of enrolled students
and their calculated course grades. In the "Grade Override" column,
enter the new course grade(s) with which you want to replace the
autocalculated grade(s).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When manually entering a course grade, you must
use the appropriate grade type for the Gradebook in which you are
working. For example, if the course is graded on a simple letter grade
scale, you will only be able to enter the letters
<code>&#160;A&#160;</code>, <code>&#160;B&#160;</code>,
<code>&#160;C&#160;</code>, <code>&#160;D&#160;</code>, or
<code>&#160;F&#160;</code>. If the course is graded on a standard
letter grade scale, you will also be able to add
<code>&#160;+&#160;</code> (plus sign) or <code>&#160;-&#160;</code>
(minus sign) to the letter grade. If the course is graded on a
pass/fail scale, you will only be able to enter the letters
<code>&#160;P&#160;</code> or <code>NP&#160;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>When you have finished updating any course grades you want to
change, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have overridden a course grade, and you want to revert back
to the autocalculated grade, do the following:</p>

<ol id="id44843190">
<li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>. If you are not already
on the Overview page of the Gradebook tool, click <strong><code>Overview</code></strong>
near the top of the window.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>At the bottom of the assignment list, click <strong><code>Course Grade</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>On the resulting page, you will see a list of enrolled
students. If you have overridden a course grade for a student, you
will see the grade you manually entered in an editable field in the
"Grade Override" column. To revert back to the autocalculated course
grade, delete the manually entered grade and click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will have to delete the manually entered
grade and click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> for each grade you want to change back.</p>
</li>
</ol>
