<p>This package provides the Sakai Id Service; a Manager and entity objects to model
globally unique and permanent identifiers.</p>
<p>The service can be used to generate a series of unique ids with the
{@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.IdManager#createId createId()}
method of the {@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.IdManager IdManager}.  The string representations of these generated ids is available from the
{@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.Id#getIdString getIdString()} method of the
{@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.Id Id} object.</p>
<p>If you have strings which can be used as unique ids, you can wrap an Id object around them with
the {@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.IdManager#getId getId(String)} method of the
{@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.IdManager IdManager}.
Be sure that the ids you use are unchanging over time, and are unique among themselves as well as among the
ids generated by the service.</p>
<p>A type specific Iterator, {@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.IdIterator IdIterator}, is defined by this service.
This can be implemented as needed, or Ids can be collected into a Collection or Array, and an IdIterator can be delivered
from the service using the {@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.IdManager#getIteratorOnCollection getIteratorOnCollection(Collection)} and
{@link org.sakaiproject.service.id.IdManager#getIteratorOnArray getIteratorOnArray(Id[])} methods of the service.</p>
