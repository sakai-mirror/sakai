<body>
 <p>This package provides the Sakai Component Manager API.</p>
 <p>The <strong>ComponentManager</strong> can be used to register and locate service components.</p>
 <p>A component is a java class which implements a Service API. Clients using a component are dependent only on the API, and can use any java class which implements the API. By using the component manager, the client class does not know which component has been selected, and has no dependency on any specific components. </p>
