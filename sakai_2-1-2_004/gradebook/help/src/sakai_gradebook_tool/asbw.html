<h2>Viewing and interpreting cumulative scores</h2>

<p>In the Gradebook, both students and instructors can view current
cumulative scores.</p>

<h4>Students</h4>
<p>When you enter the Gradebook, depending on what information your
instructor has released, you will see one or both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A "Cumulative Score", and a list of all the available assignments
and your scores on them. The cumulative score shows the total points
earned out of the total available points, and the resulting
percentage. The list of assignments shows each assignment name, its
due date (if applicable), the points earned, the total number of
points, and the grade assigned.  <br><br>
</li>
<li>A "Course Grade". This is a final grade based on assignments you
have completed and assignments still pending. Any assignments that
have not been completed will be assigned zeroes automatically.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructors</h4>
<p>When you enter the Gradebook, you will see a list of available
assignments and a "Course Grade" list. You can view cumulative scores
using one of these options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click the <strong><code>Course Grade</code></strong> link below the listed
assignments. You will see a list of all the students in the
Gradebook. For each student, the points earned, the letter grade, and
a percentage will be displayed. The letter grade and percentage are
based on the total points available for the entire course. A zero is
assigned automatically to all assignments that have not yet been
completed.



<p>To view the course grade by section or
group, next to "View", select the section or group.</p>

</li>
<li>Click the <strong><code>Roster</code></strong> link. You will see a list of all the
students in the course and a point value for each assignment in the
Gradebook. To see the cumulative scores, scroll over to the last
column. No letter grade or percentage is displayed in this view.
