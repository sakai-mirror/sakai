<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I create/add or delete
a discussion topic?
</h2>

<p>To create/add or delete a discussion topic, in your site's
menubar click <strong><code>Discussion</code></strong>, and then follow the
appropriate steps below:</p>

<h3>Creating/adding a discussion topic</h3>

<ol>

<li>Click <strong><code>Add Topic</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Enter information about your discussion topic in the fields on the
form; an asterisk indicates a field is required. You can choose a
category for your discussion topic from the drop-down list if there is
one, or create a custom one.<br><br>
</li>
<li>To limit replies to only the top-level post (i.e., your initial
post), select the <strong><code>Within this topic, only allow replies directly
to this message</code></strong> radio button. This option will create a "flat"
discussion. If you would rather choose to allow replies to any posts,
select <strong><code>Within this topic, allow replies to any
message</code></strong>. Selecting this option will create a "threaded"
discussion, which is by nature more interactive because users are able
to reply to a reply. Flat discussions, in contrast, tend to be more
structured and for this reason are more easily controlled.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>If you wish to add an attachment, follow these steps:<br><br>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>, <strong><code>Add/drop attachments</code></strong>, or
<strong><code>Add/Remove attachments</code></strong>.
</li>
<li>You can add any number of attachments, and they can be any
combination of local files, websites, and resources:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>To attach a local file from your computer, click <strong><code>Local
File...&#160;</code></strong>, and then either enter a filename in the box
provided or click <strong><code>Browse...&#160;</code></strong>. Once you find the file,
select it and click <strong><code>Open</code></strong>, then click <strong><code>Attach</code></strong>, and
finally click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to attach the item(s).


<p><strong>Note:</strong> When attaching a file, you must include the
file's extension (e.g., <code>.gif</code>, <code>.doc</code>,
<code>.html</code>, or <code>.jpg</code>). If you do not, anyone who
attempts to display or download the file will get an error
message.</p>
</li>
<li>To attach a URL, click <strong><code>Website URL...&#160;</code></strong>,
and then type the URL in the box provided. Click <strong><code>Attach</code></strong>, and
then click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.

</li>
<li>To attach an item from the "Resources" section of your site,
click <strong><code>From Resources...&#160;</code></strong>. Check the box(es) next to the
resource(s) you want to attach, then click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>, and then
click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<br>
</li>
<li>You can either save a draft (<strong><code>Save Draft</code></strong>) of your entry or
post the topic to the discussion (<strong><code>Add Topic</code></strong>). If you save it as
a draft, it will show up in the list with other discussion items, but
will be marked as a draft and will be visible only to you, the author.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Deleting a discussion topic</h3>

<p>
To delete a discussion topic, click the trash can icon next to the
topic you wish to delete. When asked to confirm that you wish to
delete the topic, click <strong><code>Delete Topic</code></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The absence of the trash can icon means that
you don't have permission to delete the message.</p>
