<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I read
assignments?
</h2>
	  
<p>To read assignments, in the relevant course site, from the
menubar, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>. You will see a list of
assignments and their status. To view any assignment, click its title.</p>

<p>If you are an instructor, you can view assignments by student. To do
so, from the "View" drop-down list, select <strong><code>Assignment List by
Student</code></strong>. You can also view assignments as students see them. To
do so, near the top of the window, click <strong><code>Student View</code></strong>.</p>
