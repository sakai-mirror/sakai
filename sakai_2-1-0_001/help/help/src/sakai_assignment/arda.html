<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I grade an assignment
or review a student's status?
</h2>
<h3>Grading an assignment</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This may not be available in your implementation of this application.</p>

<p>
To grade an assignment, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar, click the <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>
button. You will see a list of assignments.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Under the name of the assignment you want to grade, click
<strong><code>Grade</code></strong>. You will see your assignment along with student
submissions.

<br><br> 
</li>
<li>To view a student's submitted assignment and start grading, click
the student's name.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can type comments into student text by
enclosing your comments in double curly brackets (i.e.,

<code>&#160;{{your comment here}}&#160;</code>). Your comments will
appear in red. You can enter additional summary comments into the box
below the student text (no special formatting required).</p>
</li>
<li>If you would like to add an attachment to the assignment to give to the student, click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>.
<br><br>

</li>
<li>Next to "Grade:", select the grade for the student's assignment.

<br><br>

</li>
<li>If you wish to allow the student to resubmit the assignment, click
the checkbox next to <strong><code>Allow Resubmission</code></strong>.  <br><br>


</li>
<li>When grading is complete, click <strong><code>Return</code></strong> to make the
student's assignment grade immediately available, or click
<strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the submitted assignments list to continue
grading. You may also <strong><code>Preview</code></strong> how the returned assignment
will look to the student. Or, click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to return to the
assignment list.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can return assignments to students with or
without grades.</p>

</li>
<li>When you have finished grading student assignments and are ready
to make saved grades available, when viewing the list of submitted
assignments, click the <strong><code>Release Grades</code></strong> button. 
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Reviewing student status for all assignments</h3>

<p>You can view a list of your students and see each one's status on each
of the assignments. You can see whether the student has submitted the
assignment, the assignment status, and the grade if one has been
given.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar, click the <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong> button.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>From the "View" drop-down list, select <strong><code>Assignment List by
Student</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Click the black arrow next to a student's name to view the status
of his or her assignment submissions. Click the arrow again to hide
the student's information.
</li>
</ol>
