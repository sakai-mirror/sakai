<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I
    retract a published assessment?
</h2>
<p>To retract a published assessment, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  <br><br>
</li>
<li>From the Assessments page, under "Published Assessments", click
the <strong><code>Settings</code></strong> button that corresponds to the assessment you
wish to retract.<br><br>

</li>
<li>On the Settings page, click <strong><code>Delivery Dates</code></strong> to
reveal this setting's options.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Check the box beside <strong><code>Retract Date</code></strong>, then click the
calendar icon to the right of the text box. Choose a date in the past
to immediately retract the assessement, or choose a date and time at
which you want the assessment to be retracted. 
<br><br>
</li>
<li>At the bottom of the screen, click <strong><code>Save Settings</code></strong>. </li>
</ol>

<p>The retracted assessment will no longer appear under "Published
Assessment" on the My Assessments page. However, it will still be
present under "Core Assessments". From there, you can click
its title to modify the content of the assessment, or
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong> to modify its settings. If you choose to modify the
retracted assessment and republish it, remember that the newly published
assessment will have a URL different from the previously
published assessment. You'll need to distribute this URL to the people
who will be taking the revised assessment.</p>
