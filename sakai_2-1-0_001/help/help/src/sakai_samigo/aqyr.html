<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how can I create questions for my assessment?
</h2>
	  
<p>Creating questions is only one of the steps involved in creating an
assessment.
</p>

<p>You can choose from several types of questions when building an
assessment. 

</p><p>In the menubar</a> of the relevant course or project site,
click <strong><code>Tests &amp; Quizzes</code></strong>. To
create questions for an assessment, you will use the authoring tool on
the Assessments page. To create a new assessment, under the "New
Assessment" heading, type a name for your assessment in the "Title:"
field, and then click <strong><code>Create</code></strong>. You may base the assessment on
a saved template by choosing the template from the "Choose Existing
Template" drop-down menu. You also can import previously saved
questions. To do so, beside "Import assessment", click
<strong><code>Import</code></strong>. Then, click <strong><code>Browse...</code></strong> to select a file to
import. (The maximum allowed size of an imported file is 2MB.)
</p><p><a name="top"></a>

To begin adding questions to a new assessment, choose the type of
question you want to add from the "Add Question:" drop-down
menu. Below, you'll find instructions for each question type:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="#mult">Multiple Choice</a></li>
<li><a href="#survey">Survey</a></li>
<li><a href="#essay">Short Answer/Essay</a></li>
<li><a href="#fib">Fill in the Blank</a></li>
<li><a href="#mat">Matching</a></li>
<li><a href="#true">True/False</a></li>
<li><a href="#file">File Upload</a></li>
<li><a href="#upload">Copy from Question Pool</a></li>

</ul>

<a name="mult"></a><h3>Multiple Choice</h3>

<p>To create a Multiple Choice question, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:" drop-down menu,
select <strong><code>Multiple Choice</code></strong>. This takes you to the editing screen.<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.


<p><strong>Note:</strong> The value you enter in the "Answer Point
Value:" field will determine the point value for each response within
a multiple correct question. If your question has two correct answers,
entering <code>10</code> in the "Answer Point Value:" field will make
each response worth 10 points and the entire question worth 20
points.</p>
</li>
<li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the question.
You can use the formatting toolbar, which is similar to those found
within common word processing applications, to control the
text's appearance.<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the "Answer:" section, you can choose between radio buttons for
<strong><code>Single correct answer</code></strong> (the default) and <strong><code>Multiple Correct
Answers</code></strong>. As you change the selection, the screen will refresh to
allow or hide the requisite fields.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the case of a single correct answer, you'll see text boxes on
the left (four by default) in which you can enter possible
responses. To indicate which one response is correct, click the radio
button next to it. In the case of multiple correct answers, check the
boxes beside the correct responses. In either case, the boxes on the
right allow you to provide answer-level feedback for each response,
correct or incorrect.

<p>If you want to present fewer possible answers, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong> beneath the text boxes you want to remove. If you want
to present more possibilities, from the "Insert additional answers:"
drop-down menu, select the number of possibilities you want to
add.</p>
</li>
<li>If you want the possible answers to appear in a random order, next
to "Randomize Answers:", click <strong><code>Yes</code></strong>. To have them appear in
the order you see in the question editing screen (the default), click
<strong><code>No</code></strong>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>If you want to require users to provide a rationale for choosing
an answer, next to "Required Rationale:", click <strong><code>Yes</code></strong>. If you
don't require a rationale (the default), click <strong><code>No</code></strong>.<br><br>

</li>
<li>From the "Assign to Part:" drop-down menu, choose the part (i.e.,
section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this as
the default value if you haven't created any parts.<br><br>
</li>
<li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down menu, select the desired pool
name.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Under "Correct/Incorrect answer feedback:", you can provide
question-level feedback for correct and/or incorrect answers. 
<br><br>
</li>
<li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
assessment editing screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
</li>
</ol>

<a name="survey"></a><h3>Survey</h3>

<p>The process for creating a Survey question is
similar to that used to create a Multiple Choice question, except for
the following differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Answer Point Value:" field is default <code>0</code>
(zero). <br><br>
</li>
<li>For the text of possible answers, you must choose from a
predefined set of scales commonly used for survey reporting. To select
the scale you want to use, click its corresponding radio button. The
choices are as follows:<br><br>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>Yes, No</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>Disagree, Agree</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>Disagree, Undecided, Agree</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>Below Average -&gt; Above Average</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>Strongly Disagree -&gt; Strongly Agree</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>Unacceptable -&gt; Excellent</code></strong></li>

<li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 5</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 10</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
</li>
<li>You do not have the option to randomize answers or require a
rationale.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="essay"></a><h3>Short Answer/Essay</h3>

<p>
To create a Short Answer/Essay question, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:"
drop-down menu, select <strong><code>Short Answer/Essay</code></strong>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish

</li>

<li>In the "Question Text" field, enter the text for the question. If
you want more control over the graphical format of your questions, use
the formatting toolbar, which is similar to those found within common
word processing applications.<br><br>
</li>
<li>From the "Assign to Part:" drop-down menu, choose the part (i.e.,
section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this as the
default value if you haven't created any parts.<br><br>
</li>
<li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down menu, select the desired
pool name.<br><br>
</li>

answer or question-level feedback by typing it in the provided
fields.<br><br>
</li>
<li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
assessment editing screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
</li>

</ol>

<a name="fib"></a><h3>Fill in the Blank</h3>

<p>To create a Fill in the Blank question, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Questions screen, from the "Add Question:"
drop-down menu, select <strong><code>Fill in the Blank</code></strong>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the "Answer Point Value:" field, enter the point value you want
to assign to this question. Enter <code>0</code> (zero) if you wish
this to be an ungraded question.


<p><strong>Note:</strong> The value you enter in the "Answer Point
Value:" field will determine the point value for each response within
a Fill in the Blank question. If your question has two correct answers,
entering <code>10</code> in the "Answer Point Value:" field will make
each response worth 10 points and the entire question worth 20
points.</p>

</li>
<li>In the "Question Text:" field, enter the text for the
question. Place curly braces (<code>&#160;{&#160;}&#160;</code>)
around words requiring a blank, for example:

 In Unix, to find the current directory path, type {pwd} at the prompt.

<p>
If more than one response is correct for a given blank, or if you want
to allow for alternate spellings, use commas to separate the alternate
responses, for example:</p>
 Much to everyone's surprise, Darth Vader actually was Luke Skywalker's {father, dad, poppa, pater, pa, daddy}.

<p>For questions with more than one blank, each response is mutually
exclusive, meaning that each blank must contain a distinct
response. Take the following example:</p>
The colors of the American flag are {red, white, blue}, {red, white, blue}, and {red, white, blue}.

<p>
For the above, the grading engine looks for three distinct answers. To
answer correctly, the user must respond with some combination of red,
white, and blue.</p>
</li>

<li>From the "Assign to Part:" drop-down menu, choose the part (i.e.,
section) to which you want to assign this question. Leave this as the
default value if you haven't created any parts.<br><br>
</li>
<li>If you want to assign this question to a question pool, from the
"Assign to question pool:" drop-down menu, select the desired
pool name.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Under "Correct/Incorrect answer feedback:", you may choose to
provide question-level feedback.  <br><br>
</li>
<li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
Questions screen. You'll see that your new question has been
added to the assessment.
