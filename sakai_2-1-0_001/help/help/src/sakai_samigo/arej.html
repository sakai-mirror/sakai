<a name="intro"></a><h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>To reuse questions and share them with other instructors, you can
create one or more question pools. Each question pool can contain
several subpools (and subpools can contain subpools), so you can
organize questions by subject matter, section number, question type,
or any other criteria desired.</p>

<p>You can designate who is able to view, copy, edit, add, or remove
questions in the question pools and subpools that you create. </p>

<p>You can move or copy question pools and subpools to any other question
pool or subpool that you create, making the original pool a subpool of
the destination pool. Also, you can elevate a subpool to question pool
status by selecting <strong><code>Question Pool Manager</code></strong> on the Copy Pool or
Move Pool screens.</p>

<a name="create"></a><h4>Adding a question pool or subpool</h4>

<p>To create a new question pool, follow these steps:
</p><ol>
<li>On the menubar for the relevant course or project site,
click <strong><code>Tests &amp;

Quizzes</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>On the Assessments page, click <strong><code>Question Pools</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>On the Question Pools screen, click <strong><code>Add New Pool</code></strong>. Then,
on the Add Pool screen:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>In the "Pool Name" field, give your question pool a name.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The "Creator" field is filled in already with
the name of the person who logged into the current session.

</p>
</li>
<li>In the optional "Department/Group" field, you may type a department or
group name. 
</li>
<li>In the optional "Description" field, you may type a description of the
question pool. 
</li>
<li>In the optional "Objectives" field, you may type a description of the
objectives for this pool. 
</li>
<li>In the optional "Keywords" field, type any keywords that may help you or
someone else locate this question pool.</li>
</ul>
<br>
</li>
<li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to return to the
Question Pools screen. You should see your new pool listed under "Pool
Name".

</li>
</ol>

<p>To create a subpool, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>On the Question Pools screen, click the name of the pool in which
you want to make a subpool.  <br><br>
</li>
<li>In the "Subpools" section, on the right, click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>Complete the subpool fields just as you did in step 3 above, then
