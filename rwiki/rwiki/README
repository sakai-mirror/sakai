Sakai RWiki for Sakai 2
-----------------------

The provided war should be installed as sakai-rwiki.war in the webapps folder of a 
sakai tomcat instance.

Known Issues
------------

1. You should add the following to the file registrations.xml in 
components/sakai-legacy-components/WEB-INF/lib/sakai-legacy-component-2.0.0.jar:

	<function name="rwiki.create" />
	<function name="rwiki.read" />
	<function name="rwiki.update" />
	<function name="rwiki.delete" />
	<function name="rwiki.admin" />
	<function name="rwiki.superadmin" />

These are required for permissions checking.

2. ReferencedPages is not currently working. (I'm fixing this next - so watch this space)

3. Subspaces are not currently working properly. So don't add any links of the form [wibble.foo].
You'll be able to edit files but their permission realms will be in-sensible. (This is because
permission realms and subspaces are confused in the code-base, sorry!)

4. Searching is restricted to the default subspace, and doesn't check that the 
pages returned can actually be viewed by the searcher.

5. The stylesheet provided is very basic, any suggestions and improvements?

6. The jsps do not currently have the most user-friendly appearance, we're working on this but
please pass on comments.

7. There are very few unit-tests for this code, some more should be written. 
A similar statement applies for javadoc comments.
