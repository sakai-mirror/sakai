<h2>Gradebook: Overview</h2>


<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>The Gradebook is a tool for instructors to calculate, store, and
distribute grade information to students online.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Features:</strong> Using the Gradebook, instructors may:</p>

<ul>
<li>Autocalculate course grades

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Create and edit a mapping of the course letter grade to a 100
percent scale

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Add, view, edit, and release point values of assignments and/or
assessments to students

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Manually enter, view, edit, and release to students their scores
and grades

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Export scores for an assessment from Tests &amp; Quizzes to the
gradebook, which creates an assignment in the gradebook and transfers
student scores to that assignment

<br><br>

</li>
<li>Export scores and grades to Microsoft Excel (in <code>.xls</code>
or <code>.csv</code> format)
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Viewing scores:</strong> The Gradebook will allow students to
view their own scores and grades, once instructors have released them.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are different ways instructors can view information in the
Gradebook, including a general overview for each course, assignment
detail, course grade detail, student roster, adding or editing
assignments, and gradebook options.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Students can view their cumulative scores for all assignments and
the corresponding percentage; view their course grades, once an
instructor releases them; and sort their assignments by title, due
date, grade, and total possible points per assignment.
