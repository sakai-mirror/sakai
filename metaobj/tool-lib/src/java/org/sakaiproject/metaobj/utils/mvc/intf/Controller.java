/**
 * Our Controller framework is build on top of the Spring's mvc framework.  We provide
 * an extra layer of abstraction that is not bound to any particular technology
 * (servlet, portlet, thick GUI, etc).  In order to use our framework you really
 * should have good understanding of spring's mvc architecture especially the
 * SimpleFormController and AbstractCommandController.  We assume you understand
 * what a backing object is, and the flow for form submission, and validation.
 *
 * This interface provides the basic Controller functionality.  The system
 * binds request params into the requestModel, and calls handleRequest.  The requestModel
 * type is configured in the spring config using the commandClass property.  By default
 * the no argument constructor will be used to create this object.  If you require more
 * control over how this backing object is created implement CustomCommandController.
