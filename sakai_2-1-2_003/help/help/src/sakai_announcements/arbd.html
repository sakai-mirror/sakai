<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I read
announcements?
</h2>

<p>You may read announcements from within each worksite to which you
belong. To do so, enter a site, and from the menubar, click
<strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>. To read an announcement, click its title.</p>

<p>Alternatively, from My Workspace, you can view a
consolidated list of announcements from all of your sites. To do so,
enter My Workspace, and from the menubar click
<strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>. To read an announcement, click its title.</p>

<p>To change the ordering of the announcements list, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>To arrange the announcements alphabetically by title, click
<strong><code>Subject</code></strong>. Click <strong><code>Subject</code></strong> again to reverse the order.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>To arrange the announcements alphabetically by the author's last
name, click <strong><code>From</code></strong>. Click <strong><code>From</code></strong> again to reverse the
order.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>To arrange the announcements alphabetically by the originating site,
click <strong><code>Site</code></strong>. Click <strong><code>Site</code></strong> again to reverse the
order.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>To arrange the announcements chronologically, click <strong><code>Date</code></strong>.
Click <strong><code>Date</code></strong> again to reverse the order.
</li>

</ul>

<p>The title of any draft announcement will have the prefix "Draft"
before the title.</p>
