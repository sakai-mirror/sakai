<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I view and open
resources?
</h2>

<p>When you click <strong><code>Resources</code></strong> in the menubar, you will
see a list of the site's resources and folders containing
resources. You can then do the following to browse through the
available material:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Click a resource's title to open it.

<br><br>
</li>

<li>To view the contents of a folder, click the folder icon next to
the folder name or the name itself to open it, or click the black
arrow next to the folder name to expand it (i.e., make its contents
visible without opening it).

<br><br>
</li>
<li>You can navigate between resources and folders using the document
path ("breadcrumbs") above the resource list; simply click a folder
name in the breadcrumb line to go to that folder. You can also click
the icon of a folder with an arrow in it to go up one level.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>You can sort the resources by title (click <strong><code>Title</code></strong>), size
(click <strong><code>Size</code></strong>), the resource creator (click <strong><code>Created
by</code></strong>), and the date the resources were last modified (click <strong><code>Last
modified</code></strong>). To reverse the order, click any of these links again.

<br><br>
</li>

<li>To view a resource, click the name of the resource, or the icon
next to it. You may need to agree to a copyright statement, and then
you will see the resource.
</li>
</ul>
