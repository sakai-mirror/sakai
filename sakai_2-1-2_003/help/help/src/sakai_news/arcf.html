<h2>Sakai 2.0 News: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The News tool uses RSS to bring dynamic news to your
worksite. RSS is a data format that is used to syndicate news on the
web. It allows continuously updated content from a remote news site to
appear in another website.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>RSS:</strong> To set up your worksite to display news, you
must specify a URL that points to an RSS news feed. An RSS
news feed is a specially formatted list of news articles. You can find
RSS feeds by using an Internet search engine (e.g., Google
or Yahoo). Sites that distribute news in RSS format are called "news
feeds". The News tool is an RSS "news aggregator" (or "news reader")
that reads and displays content from RSS news feeds.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can add more than one News feed when you set up the site, or
at a later time.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>In addition to news, some websites use the RSS format for
information that is updated often, such as blogs (web logs that serve
as publicly accessible personal journals), events listings, or the
revision history of a book.

</ul>
