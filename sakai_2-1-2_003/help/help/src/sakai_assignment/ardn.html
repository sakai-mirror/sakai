<h2>Sakai 2.0 Assignments: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>For courses, the Assignments tool allows instructors to create,
distribute, collect, and grade online assignments. Assignments are
private; student submissions are not visible to other users of the
site.</p>

<p>The Assignments tool offers multiple grading options, including letter
grades, points, checkmarks, pass/fail, or ungraded.</p>

<p>Assignments can also be returned, with or without grades, for
re-submission. Instructors can download all submissions to an
assignment to their computer at once. When instructors release grades
for an assignment, students can access instructor comments and their
grades.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Student View:</strong> Student View allows you as an
instructor or site maintainer to view assignments as they would appear
to your students or project participants. To learn more about using
Student View, see Seeing how assignments look to participants.</p>

<p><strong>Honor Pledge:</strong> This option requires students to click
a checkbox affirming that they have neither given nor received aid on
an assignment before they can submit it.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Instructors can return assignments and allow for
re-submission. This feature can be used to evaluate drafts of final
projects or papers, or to allow students to correct and re-submit an
assignment.
