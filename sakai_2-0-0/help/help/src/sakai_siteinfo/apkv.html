For each of these functions, you can set permissions that allow or prevent users from seeing or performing certain tasks depending on a user's role.</p><h3>Key concepts</h3><h4>Access</h4><p>This role is similar to the student role.</p><h4>Maintain</h4><p>This role gives users full permissions throughout the site. The maintain role is automatically given to the site creator. A user with the maintain role can delete the site.</p><h3>Things to remember</h3><p>The maintain and access roles are granted to users automatically when an official course site is created.</p><p>Roles are given default permissions. You can add additional permissions, but you cannot remove any default permissions.</p></body></html>
