<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>The Site Info tool provides information about the site you are in. If
your role on that site is "maintain", you can use this tool to make
changes to information about the site, tools, and access to the
site. You can also publish the site using the Site Info tool.</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>
<p>Site Info displays a participant list, so that you can edit access to
your site. It also displays a list of tools available on the site,
which you may add or remove.

</p><h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>The functions of the Site Info tool are also available in the Worksite
Setup tool, which is visible when you have My Workspace open.</li></ul>
