 *
 * <p>Description:
 * This is an integrated context implementation helper delegate class for
 * the GradebookFacade class.
 * "Integrated" means that Samigo (Tests and Quizzes)
 * is running within the context of the Sakai portal and authentication
 * mechanisms, and therefore makes calls on Sakai for things it needs.</p>
 * <p>Note: To customize behavior you can add your own helper class to the
 * Spring injection via the integrationContext.xml for your context.
 * The particular integrationContext.xml to be used is selected by the
 * build process.
