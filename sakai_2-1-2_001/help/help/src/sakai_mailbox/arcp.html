<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how can I search for a message
in an Email Archive?
</h2>
	  
<p>To search for a word in the email messages within an archive, follow
these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar of the course site or
project site containing the archive, click <strong><code>Email
Archive</code></strong>.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the text box near the top of the screen, type the word for
which you want to search, and then click <strong><code>Search</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Email Archive search is not case
sensitive. Also, you can search only for a single word. Do not use
quotation marks around your search term unless you are searching for a
term in quotation marks.</p>
</li>
<li>A list of search results will appear. You may click the linked
subject line to view a message. Once you are viewing a message, click
<strong><code>Return to List</code></strong> to return to your search results. Click
<strong><code>View Headers</code></strong> while viewing a message to see the full
headers; click <strong><code>Hide Headers</code></strong> to hide them (the button
toggles between these two options).

<br><br>
</li>
<li>On the search results screen, click <strong><code>Clear Search</code></strong> or the
reset button to return to the default Email Archive display (the list
of all email messages in the archive). Or you may search the archive
again.
</li>
</ol>
