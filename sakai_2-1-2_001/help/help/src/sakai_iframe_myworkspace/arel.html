<h2>Sakai 2.0 Membership: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>The Membership tool in My Workspace is where you can
join and unjoin available worksites.
</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Sites:</strong> On the Membership tool page, you'll see a
list of all the worksites to which you belong. This includes sites you
have joined, and sites that you have been added to as a participant by
the creator of the site.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Joinable Sites:</strong> The <strong><code>Joinable Sites</code></strong> link will
display a listing of available sites that you haven't joined. You can
click <strong><code>Join</code></strong> for any of these sites.
</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
