<h2>Sakai 2.0 Preferences: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What they do</h3>

<p>
In your My Workspace, you can set Preferences for how and
how often you receive email notification of worksite activity, such as
Email Archive messages, Announcements, and added Resources. You can
also choose the worksites for which you'd like to see tabs.
</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3> 

<p><strong>Notification methods:</strong> You may choose one of three
notification methods for Announcement activity, Email Archive
messages, and Resource activity:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Daily digest:</strong> Individual Announcements,
Resources, and/or mail messages are bundled into a single email
message and sent to you daily.

<br><br> 
</li>
<li>
<strong>Receive individually when posted:</strong> You receive
email notification each time that an Announcement is posted, a
Resource is added, and/or email is sent.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Block:</strong> You receive no notification regarding low
priority site activity.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Customize Tabs:</strong> By default, you will see a tab for
each site to which you belong. If you wish to change which tabs are
visible, click <strong><code>Customize Tabs</code></strong> and select the tabs for which
you'd like to change the visibility.
</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>You cannot have different Preferences for individual
worksites. For example, if you change your Email Archive notification
to "daily digest", you will get a daily email from each of the sites
to which you belong. Or, if you choose to block Announcements,
notifications about low priority announcements will be blocked for all
sites to which you belong.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>You cannot block receipt of high priority notifications. 
Notification is immediately sent whenever there is high priority site
activity.
</li>
</ul>
