<h2>Sakai 2.0 Resources: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>The Resources tool is the most widely used feature in classes and
collaborations. In Resources, you can make many kinds of material
available online. There are three types of resources: documents (e.g.,
word processing documents, spreadsheets, slide presentations, plain
text), links to websites, and simple text documents that display right
on the page.</p>



<p>You can post up to 10 resources at a time, post items outside of
folders, create folders inside other folders, and create
HTML documents.</p>

<p>Using the Permissions feature, site owners can control which types of
users can read, post, revise, and/or delete files in specific
folders. Site owners and instructors can make a resource available to
anyone by choosing to post it with the "public view" setting checked.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Viewing resources:</strong> When you click <strong><code>Resources</code></strong>
in a site's menubar, you will see a list of that site's resources and
folders containing resources. Click a resource's title to open it. To
view the contents of a folder, click the folder icon next to the
folder's name or the name itself to open it, or click the black arrow
next to the folder's name to expand it (i.e., make its contents
visible without opening it).</p>

<p><strong>Sorting resources:</strong> You can sort the resources by
title, size, resource creator, and last modified date. </p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many classes post weekly readings in their Resources. These can
include links to websites as well as to other kinds of documents, like
Adobe PDF files. Some classes also post presentations or
slides used in lectures.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Using Permissions, a large collaboration site can use one folder
in Resources as a space to archive important documents, and allow only
certain site participants to modify those documents.</li>
