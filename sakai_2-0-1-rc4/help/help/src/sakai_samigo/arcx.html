<ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;

Quizzes</code></strong>.  
<br><br>
</li>
<li>From the Assessments page, under "Core Assessments", find the
title of the desired assessment, and click the corresponding
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong> button.

</li>
<li>You'll see a prompt asking you to confirm the deletion. If you're
certain you want to delete this assessment, click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.
