<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, what assessment settings are
available?
</h2>

<p>To reach the Settings page for an assessment, from the menubar of
the appropriate worksite, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  On the Assessments page, click
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong> beneath the title of the assessment.  Click the
black arrow for a type of setting to see the options. The settings
available depend on whether or not your assessment is published. 

They
also depend on what template you have created for use with an
assessment. The default template does not include all possible
settings. Once an assessment is published, you may only edit
the Delivery Dates setting.</p>

<p>If you wish to include more settings than you see available for an
unpublished assessment, you will need to create and edit a new
template. </p>
