<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, what modifications can I
    make to an existing assessment?
</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you wish to add, delete, or modify
questions in an assessment, you must do so while the assessment is
still only under "Core Assessments" on the Assessments page. You
<strong>cannot</strong> change the questions once an assessment is
published. Once an assessment is published, you can modify only the
"Delivery Dates"  setting.</p>

<p>You can modify several components of an existing, unpublished
assessment that you created, including the settings, the questions,
and the parts.</p>

<h3>Modifying the settings</h3>

<p>To modify the settings of an existing assessment, follow these steps:
</p><ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  
<br><br>
</li>
<li>From the Assessments page, under "Core Assessments", find the
desired assessment and click the corresponding <strong><code>Settings</code></strong>
button.<br><br>
</li>
<li>On the Settings page, click the arrow next to each setting to
expand it and reveal its options. You now can modify the options for
each setting. 

</li>
<li>When you're finished, to save your changes, click <strong><code>Save
Settings</code></strong>. You will return to the Assessments page. To keep
the original settings and discard any changes, click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You also can modify the settings by clicking
<strong><code>Settings</code></strong> in the editing screen.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Modifying the parts</h3>

<p>To modify the parts (i.e., sections) of an existing assessment,
follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  
<br><br>
</li>
<li>From the Assessments page, under "Core Assessments", find the
desired assessment and click its title to enter the editing screen.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> At the top, you will see a bar containing
three options: <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>, <strong><code>Settings</code></strong>, and <strong><code>Preview
Assessment</code></strong>. Click <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong> to create or modify a
part. Click <strong><code>Settings</code></strong> to modify the settings for the
assessment as described above. Click <strong><code>Preview Assessment</code></strong> to
see how the assessment will appear to those taking it.

</p>
</li>
<li>Every assessment must contain at least one part. Parts are
signified within an assessment by a box containing the part title, a
drop-down menu for determining the order of the parts, plus two
options, <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> and <strong><code>Modify</code></strong>. Each new assessment will
include an automatically created part called "Part 1 Default". You
have the following options:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>To change the order in which a part appears in your assessment, change the number in the drop-down menu in the part's title bar.
</li>
<li>To remove a part, click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> You'll have the option to remove the part only (and move its questions to another part) or remove the part and all its questions.

</li>
<li>To modify the title of the part, click <strong><code>Modify</code></strong> and enter a new title in the "Title" field. Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to save
your changes.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you do not change the default part's
name, its heading (i.e., gray divider) will not appear on your
assessment. Any questions or images you place in this part
<strong>will</strong> appear; only the heading will be hidden.
</p>
</li>
<li>To change the order of the questions within the part, click

<strong><code>Modify</code></strong> and then choose either <strong><code>As listed on Assessment
Questions page</code></strong> or <strong><code>Random within Part</code></strong>.

</li>
<li>To add or change Metadata, click <strong><code>Modify</code></strong> and enter the
information in the appropriate fields given.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Modifying the questions</h3>

<p>To modify the questions of an existing assessment, follow these
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  
<br><br>
</li>
<li>From the Assessments page, under "Core Assessments", find the
desired assessment and click its title to enter the editing
screen.<br><br>

</li>
<li>Each question is represented by a bar containing the question
number, the type of question and its answer point value, and two
buttons, <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> and <strong><code>Modify</code></strong>. You have the following
options:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Use the "Question" drop-down menu to change the order in which the
questions appear.
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> to delete the question from the
assessment. Doing so will take you to a confirmation
page. If you're certain you want to remove the question, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong>. To keep the question, click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.

</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Modify</code></strong> to open the question editing screen. Here,
you can change the answer point value for the question, the question text,
the part to which the question is assigned, and the answer(s) for
the question. Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to keep your changes or
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to cancel your changes.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To add more questions to the assessment, you have two options:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>On the editing screen, beneath the assessment title bar, use the
"Add Question:" drop-down menu to select the type of question to add.
</li>
<li>On the editing screen, at the bottom of each question,
you can use the "Insert New Question" drop-down menu to select the type of
question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
