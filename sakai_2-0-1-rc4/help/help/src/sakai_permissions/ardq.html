<h2>In Sakai 2.0, from Worksite Setup, how do I
change roles for participants?
</h2>
<p>From Worksite Setup in My Workspace, you can change the
roles you assigned to site participants. To do so, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the menubar in My Workspace, click <strong><code>Worksite
Setup</code></strong>.  <br><br>

</li>
<li>Check the box next to the site in which you wish to change
participants' roles, and then click <strong><code>Revise</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although you can check multiple
boxes, you can only revise the tools in one site at a time. </p>

</li>
<li>Below your site's information, you will see its participant list,
which contains each participant's name, role, and status. For each
participant that you wish to modify, select the role(s) for the
participant(s), and then click <strong><code>Update</code></strong>. 
</li>
</ol>
