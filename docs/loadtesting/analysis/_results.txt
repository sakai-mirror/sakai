Result: Logins and downloads are closely correlated.  On average, there are about 2 content downloads per login.  This is reasonably accurate on a timescale of an hour/day/semester.

Reasoning:
Overall ratio of downloads:logins is 1.89:1 for all of winter 2005 term.
Max logins ever seen per hour was 2422 logins on 11-Jan-2005 17:00-18:00.
Content downloaded that hour was 5643
Ratio of downloads:logins is 2.33:1 for that hour.

The graphs of logins and downloads match very closely!  Look at the attached graph to see how downloads=2*logins makes sense.


Result: per-hour, per-day, and per-semester are reasonable time scales to look at.  Less than per-hour isn't so meaningful - once it gets down to the minute level, there are almost no noticable patterns.


Result: Logins and sessions are closely correlated per-hour.  There is almost a 1:1 ratio.  Makes sense, don't it?

Result:
