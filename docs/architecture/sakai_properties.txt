Sakai Properties


Introduction

This document describes configurations that can be made using entries in
the sakai.properties file. The organization and use of the sakai.properties
file is covered in the document How to Configure Sakai[1].  Properties
described are found in the sakai.properties file, or in the components.xml
file, or both.

The sakai.properties file is at
/trunk/sakai/kernel/component/src/config/org/sakaiproject/config
in subversion, and should be placed in a folder named 'Sakai' in the tomcat
root directory (e.g. in /usr/local/tomcat/sakai).

The components.xml file is at
/trunk/sakai/legacy/legacy-components/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml in
subversion and is installed in the <tomcat root>/components/sakai-legacy-
components/WEB-INF directory.

In the definitions below, the property is listed, followed by the default
setting (if there is one), and an explanation of the property. In some
cases the comment included with the property in the sakai.properties file
says it all. Those comments are included below.

The appendices include a sakai.properties file from Sakai release 2.1, and
a copy of the sakai.properties file in use at the University of Michigan.

Sakai OOTB is an alias for the default install of Sakai  - Sakai Out Of The
Box.

Properties are grouped together below according to their function. The
index provides an alphabetized list.

Database related configurations



hibernate.dialect

      # set the hibernate dialect (for shared datasource), HSQLDB by
      default, mySql and Oracle examples

      hibernate.dialect=net.sf.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
      #hibernate.dialect=net.sf.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
      #hibernate.dialect=net.sf.hibernate.dialect.Oracle9Dialect

      Sakai 2.1 supports 3 databases. By default, hibernate.dialect is set
      for HSQLDB. Examples are shown for MySQL and Oracle settings.
      Uncomment the appropriate setting to correspond with the database
      used, and remove/comment the others.



auto.ddl

      # establish auto.ddl - on by default

      auto.ddl=true
      #auto.ddl=false

      When Sakai starts up, if auto.ddl is set to true, necessary database
      tables will be created if needed (if the tables do not already exist).



defaultTransactionIsolationString


      defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=
      TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED

      Used to set the default transaction isolation level. The default
      setting above (set in a components.xml file) is used for hsql. For
      Oracle or MySQL, set it in sakai.properties to the
      TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED value:


      defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=
                                  TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED

      Note: the settings used for Sakai prior to 2.1.005 below no longer are
      supported.
      # set the default transaction isolation level
      # Up to and including 1.7.1, HSQLDB supports only
      Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED.

      # MySQL and Oracle MUST use Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED.
      jdbc.defaultTransactionIsolation=
            java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED
      #jdbc.defaultTransactionIsolation=
            java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED



Server Information


serverId

      # identify your application server with a short name, unique among the
      servers in your cluster.
      # choose a server id even if you are running a single app server

      serverId=localhost

      Used to distinguish servers in a cluster from one another. The
      serverId  value is the server name displayed in the footer and in the
      Admin Online tool.

      For example, if serverId=phantom, the footer displays
                                    [pic]



serverUrl

      # the URL to the server, including transport, DNS name, and port, if
      any

      serverUrl=http://localhost:8080

      Should be set to match the 'port' defined in the
      CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml file



serverName

      # the DNS name of the server

      serverName=localhost



gatewaySiteId

      # gateway site id

      gatewaySiteId=!gateway

      The site id of the site which is used for the installation's gateway
      (login page). This site will be shown when users go to the URL set in
      the serverURL property.

      With the defaults, going to the URL  http://localhost:8080 will take
      the user to the !gateway site where they find the Login button (and
      perhaps the user name and password fields depending on the top.login
      setting) . The !gateway site typically will contain a MOTD (message of
      the day), and perhaps a web content tool pointing to another document
      containing installation specific information. The !gateway site may
      have a left hand menu column of page names. The pages may contain
      things like 'Features', 'About', 'Training', etc. The Sakai OOTB
      !gateway site includes a New Account page, which contains the
      new.account tool. Institutions will want to edit the !gateway site to
      add/remove pages/tools, or create their own gateway site.



loggedOutUrl

      # the URL to send folks to after they logout

      loggedOutUrl=/portal

      When users click the 'logout' button, they are sent to
      <serverUrl><loggedOutUrl>
      With the default settings, this would be http://localhost:8080/portal



accessPath


      accessPath=/access

      Specifies the URL to the access path. This partial URL is used to
      construct the full URL for accessing resources. For example, the URL
      to a resource might be http://localhost:8080/access/content/group/
      1100899697301-3493876 /report.doc where /content/group/ 1100899697301-
      3493876 /report represents the location of the resource.



portalPath


      portalPath=/portal

      Specifies the URL to the portal path. This partial URL is used to
      construct the full URL for accessing Sakai (e.g.,
      http://localhost:8080/portal )



helpPath


      helpPath=/help

      Specifies the URL to the help path. This partial URL is used to
      construct the full URL for accessing help content. For example,
      http://localhost:8082/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=aqyk



top.login

      # to include the user id and password for login on the gateway site

      top.login=true

      Controls whether the 'user id' and 'password' fields are shown in the
      banner at the top of the Sakai window. If top.login=false, the two
      fields are not shown.

                                                                       [pic]
      When an external authorization mechanism is present, installations may
      want top.login=false to hide the native Sakai login fields.



container.login

      # to let the container handle login or not (set to true for single-
      signon type setups, false for just internal login)

      container.login=false

      In Sakai OOTB, there is no external login authoricy (e.g., CAS or
      cosign) setup by default, so container.login=false to let Sakai handle
      logins. When set to false, Sakai login processing can be bypassed
      since we trust the container if it says that the user is already
      logged in.

      These two control the extra (x) login button - if it's enabled,  what
      text to show.  There should be another for the icon.  Then you  get
      two logins - one normal, and one that is "xlogin" that bypasses  the
      container check


xlogin.enabled


      xlogin.enabled=

      If xlogin.enabled=true, then a 2nd login button will appear (depending
      on xlogin.text or xlogin.icon). The 2nd 'xlogin' button bypasses the
      container check, and is a way to login to a native Sakai account.

      Note that when xlogin.enabled=false, though the 2nd login button
      doesn't appear, it is still possible to login via xlogin using the URL
      such as http://localhost:8080/portal/xlogin.



xlogin.text


      xlogin.text=

      Specifies the test to show for a 2nd login button in the Sakai header
      (the xlogin button). For xlogin.text to show, top.login must be false,
      and xlogin.enabled must be true.


      For example, with the settings of

            xlogin.text=Mash me
            top.login=false
            xlogin.enabled=true

      The following appears
                                    [pic]
      The xlogin button can be text or an icon but not both. If both
      xlogin.text and xlogin.icon have a value, the icon 'wins'.



xlogin.icon


      xlogin.icon=

      Specifies an icon to use for a 2nd login button in the Sakai header
      (the xlogin button). For xlogin.icon to show, top.login must be false,
      and xlogin.enabled must be true.

      For example, with the following settings,

           xlogin.icon=<path to bullseye icon>
            top.login=false
            xlogin.enabled=true

      The following appears

                                    [pic]

      The xlogin button can be text or an icon but not both. If both
      xlogin.text and xlogin.icon have a value, the icon 'wins'.



Footer Control


bottomnav.count


bottomnav.n


      bottomnav.count=
      bottomnav.1=

      Specifies links that can appear at the top of the footer. Links are
      displayed in an order according to their bottomnav.n association, with
      the bottomnav.1 item appearing first, bottomnav.2 item second, etc.  A
      vertical bar | separates links. There are bottomnav.count number of
      links shown. Each link URL is specified by the bottomnav.n value.

      Since there are no default bottomnav links specified in Sakai OOTB,
      the footer area where such links appear is empty.

                                                                       [pic]

      To add links, create values for the properties. For example, at UM we
      have

      bottomnav.count = 5
      bottomnav.1 = <a href="https://ctools.umich.edu/portal/site/!gateway">
      CTools Gateway</a>
      bottomnav.2 = <a href="mailto:ctools@umich.edu">Contact Us</a>
      bottomnav.3 = <a href="http://www.dc.umich.edu/"
      target="_blank">Duderstadt Center</a>
      bottomnav.4 = <a href="http://www.umich.edu/"
      target="_blank">University of Michigan</a>
      bottomnav.5 = <a href="http://sakaiproject.org" target="_blank">The
      Sakai Project</a>

      which produces
                                                                       [pic]

      (The 'Powered by Sakai' icon is controlled by the powered.url and
      associated properties)

      Note: Since Sakai is xhtml, links should be xhtml (e.g.,
      <a href="" title="" target="">Anchor</a>

      The title should contain a warning if target="_blank".



powered.url


powered.img


powered.alt

      # powered by config for the bottom of the portal

      powered.url.count=1
      powered.url.1=http://sakaiproject.org
      powered.img.count=1
      powered.img.1=/library/image/sakai_powered.gif
      powered.alt.count=1
      powered.alt.1=Powered by Sakai

      These control the display and hyperlink of the 'powered by' icon in
      the footer. You can add additional logos with their own links and alt
      text. For example, if you added a gif file named 'wolverine.gif' to
      /library/image directory, and had the following in sakai.properties,
      the 'powered by' section of the footer would look as follows.

      powered.url.count=2
      powered.url.1=http://sakaiproject.org
      powered.url.2=http://www.umich.edu
      powered.img.count=2
      powered.img.1=/library/image/sakai_powered.gif
      powered.img.2=/library/image/wolverine.gif
      powered.alt.count=2
      powered.alt.1=Powered by Sakai
      powered.alt.2=University of Michigan

                                    [pic]

      Clicking on the wolverine icon sends the user to the University of
      Michigan web site.

      The 'powered by' icons open their links in a new browser window.



bottom.copyrighttext

      # strings for the portal pages

      bottom.copyrighttext=(c) 2003, 2004, 2005 sakaiproject.org. All rights
      reserved.

                                    [pic]

      Specifies a line of text just under the 'powered by' icon in the
      footer.



version.service


version.sakai

      version.service=2.0.1
      version.sakai=2.0.1

      Specifies versioning footer text. Installations may want to designate
      their own versioning scheme.
                                    [pic]

      For example, at UM, we have
            version.service= [r2236]
            version.sakai= 2.0.0[506121]

      which produces the following in the footer:
                                    [pic]

      Also see ui.service (set to 'CTools' in the example above), and
      bottom.copyrighttext (set to 'Copyright © 2003 - 2005, the Regents of
      The University of Michigan' above)



OOTB Information Files

Note regarding content of these files. Since Sakai is xhtml, links in the
files should be xhtml (e.g., <a href="" title="" target="">Anchor</a> ).
The title should contain a warning if target="_blank".


server.info.url


      server.info.url=/library/content/server_info.html

      Displayed by the sakai.iframe.service tool, which is typically found
      on the !gateway site. The server_info.html file has been used to
      provide information about the institution's installation.

      To be able to change the displayed content without having to re-deploy
      Sakai, you could change the location to
      server.info.url= /content/public/server_info.html.
      Then you could upload a file called server_info.html into the Admin's
      Resources/public folder, and make edits there anytime as needed
      without a re-deploy.



myworkspace.info.url


      myworkspace.info.url=/library/content/myworkspace_info.html

      Displayed by the sakai.iframe.myworkspace tool, which is typically
      found on the Home page of My Workspaces. The myworkspace_info.html
      file has been used to provide information to users about the function
      of their My Workspace.

      See the comments for server.info.url for information about why you may
      want to change the location of the myworkspace_info.html file.



webcontent.instructions.url


      webcontent.instructions.url=/library/content/
                                  webcontent_instructions.html

      Displayed by the sakai.iframe tool when the URL field for that tool is
      blank. The webcontent.instructions.html file contains text that
      explains what to do to point a sakai.iframe tool (Web Content tool) to
      a particular URL. If the URL field for the Web Content tool contains a
      URL, then the Web Content tool displays the content at the URL rather
      then the webcontent.instructions.html text.

      See the comments for server.info.url for information about why you may
      want to change the location of the myworkspace_info.html file


User Presence List


display.users.present

      # to enable presence display in the portal

      display.users.present=false

      Controls whether or not the Users Present list shows in the left hand
      menu column below page names. When display.users.present=true, the
      left hand menu column includes the Users Present list in each site.
      The list shows those who are 'present' (looking at) any page of the
      site. In the example below, 3 users are present in the site.  You
      cannot tell from the list which page in the site users are focused on.
                                    [pic]
                     Users Present list is displayed if
                         display.users.present=true

skin.default

      # The default skin for sites without a skin setting

      skin.default=default

      Sites get this skin if no value is selected when creating a course
      site. All project sites use this skin.



skin.repo

      # the path to the skin files

      skin.repo=/library/skin

      The location of css and image files used in skinning Sakai.



iconNames.count


iconNames.n

      # for worksite setup, which offers a list of Appearance (Icon) choices
      (course sites only)

      iconNames.count=3
      iconNames.1=humanities
      iconNames.2=engineering
      iconNames.3=pig

      Sets the values that will show up in the 'Appearance (icon)' field
dropdown.

                                    [pic]
          Values that appear in the Appearance (Icon): dropdown are
                     specified in iconNames.n properties

      The names are associated (via the iconUrls property) with gif files.
      The gif selected via the dropdown shows up at the top of the left hand
      menu column in the worksite (see the figure in the iconUrls
      description)



iconUrls


      iconUrls.count=3
      iconUrls.1=/library/icon/humanities.gif
      iconUrls.2=/library/icon/engineering.gif
      iconUrls.3=/library/icon/pig.gif

      Specifies the location of the 'worksite icon' which shows up at the
      top of the left hand menu column in the worksite. The particular icon
      is chosen from the 'Appearance (icon)'field dropdown menu when
      creating a class worksite.

      For example, selecting 'humanities' (the iconNames.1 property) from
      the dropdown when creating a class site puts the humanities icon (the
      iconUrls.1 icon) in the left hand menu column.

                                    [pic]
                      Placement of the iconUrls.n icon



iconSkins


      iconSkins.count=3
      iconSkins.1=
      iconSkins.2=
      iconSkins.3=examp-u

      Used to provide additional skins which will override the default skin
      if desired. Normally, the default skin is used in a site, and the
      iconName.n value selected in the Appearance dropdown when creating a
      class site just indicates which worksite icon to use. However, if a
      value is set for an iconSkins.n property, then that value is used as
      the skin when the corresponding iconName.n value is chosen from the
      Appearance dropdown.

      With the defaults, selecting the 'pig' value (the iconNames.3
      property) from the Appearance dropdown when creating a class site
      gives the site the examp-u skin (set by the iconSkins.3 property).



disable.course.site.skin.selection

      #show/hide icon/url list with course site edit info

      disable.course.site.skin.selection=

      When creating a course site, the appearance of the site skin can be
      customized by adding an icon at the top of the left hand menu column.
      disable.course.site.skin.selection controls the ability to edit that
      skin once the site has been created. If set to true, the Appearance
      Icon dropdown does not appear when editing the site with Worksite
      Setup or Site Info's Edit Site Information function.

                                    [pic]
    By default, the Appearance Icon dropdown appears when editing a site.
       If disable.course.site.skin.selection=true, the field will not
                         appear when editing a site.





logout.icon


      logout.icon=

      If set, causes the image specified by the URL value to appear in the
      upper right corner of the Sakai page after login.

      For example, if logout.icon=<url to a closing door icon>, the icon
      will replace the Logout button.

Accessibility


accessibility.url

      #the location (url) of the accessibility info
      #accessibility.url=http://www.umich.edu/~umctdocs/
                              Accessibility.html

      If there is a value (URL), it renders an invisible link in the portal
      to the URL given by the value. This is so that screen reader users can
      go to a summary page of how to navigate Sakai with a screen reader.

      Sakai OOTB does not have a value set for accessibility.url.



Resources Storage, Control


content.upload.max

      # upload limit per request, in megs

      content.upload.max=20

      When uploading files into Resources, there can be a limit set to
      control the size of files uploaded. Some institutions may want to
      control how large files in Resources are to minimize problems site
      participants may have downloading large files over dial-up lines.

      This limit is not enforced when uploading files via WebDav.

      The limit applies to all files in an upload action. If 3 files are
      uploaded, the combined size of all 3 files cannot exceed the
      content.upload.max setting.

      MySQL note: The MySQL database has its own file size limit, stored in
      a variable called max_allowed_packet, which is 1Mb by default. Visit
      this page for instructions on changing it:
      http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/program-variables.html

      This limit should not be confused with the max space setting that can
      be set per site, which puts a limit on the total size of all resources
      in a site.  The max size per site limit is set in the components.xml
      file. The siteQuota property in the
      org.sakaiproject.service.legacy.content.ContentHostingService bean
      sets the limit to a default of 1Gb.

      <bean
      id="org.sakaiproject.service.legacy.content.ContentHostingService"

      ...snip...

      <property name="siteQuota"><value>1048576</value></property>

      </bean>

      This can be overridden in sakai.properties. For example,
           siteQuota@.sakaiproject.service.legacy.content.
           ContentHostingService = 2000000

      The max size limit of a site's Resources can be set on a site by site
      basis, to override the installation default set by siteQuota. Visit
      the site as admin, click on the Edit Properties link for the top level
      folder. An editable field on the properties page can be used to
      override the siteQuota value for the site.

copyrighttype.own


      copyrighttype.own=I hold copyright.

      The copyright for an item in Resources can be automatically
      constructed to include the user's name. copyrighttype.own specifies
      which item in the Copyright Status list (which copyrighttype.n value)
      when chosen causes the Copyright Information field to be seeded with a
      default copyright notice that includes the user's name.

      With the defaults, if the user selects 'I hold copyright.' From the
      Copyright Status list, the Copyright Information field is seeded with
      the text "copyright © <year>, <username>. All rights reserved" where
      <year> is the current year, and <username> is replaced by the users
      First Last name.

                                    [pic]

fairuse.url


      fairuse.url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu

      On the Add Item page of Resources, there is a 'more info' link next to
      the 'Copyright Status' field that can be used to provide information
      about copyright issues. The default points to a page served by
      Stanford about Fair Use.

                                    [pic]
 The fairuse.url property specifies what URL to use for the 'more info' link



newcopyrightinput


      newcopyrightinput=true

      Controls the appearance of the 'Copyright Information' field on the
      Add Item page of Resources. If newcopyrightinput=false, the Copyright

resources.show_all_collections.tool

      # indicates whether users should see "Show Other Sites" twiggle in
      list mode of resources tool

      resources.show_all_collections.tool=true

      The Resources list changed with 2.1 to include the ability to show
      resources from other sites in which the user is a participant. When
      resources.show_all_collections.tool=true, the list includes a twiggle
      control that is used to toggle open the list of Resource folders from
      other sites. If resources.show_all_collections.tool=false, the twiggle
      control does not appear and users see only resources for the site in a
      site.
                                    [pic]
                  Resources from other sites are shown when
            resources.show_all_collections.tool=true, and can be
                          shown or hidden with the
                 'hide other sites|show other sites' toggle


                                    [pic]
                Only resources from the site are shown in the
        Resources tool when resources.show_all_collections.tool=false




resources.show_all_collections.dropbox

      # indicates whether users should see "Show Other Sites" twiggle in
      list mode of dropbox tool

      resources.show_all_collections.dropbox=false

      The DropBox list changed with 2.1 to include the ability to optionally
      show resources from other sites in which the user is a participant.
                                    [pic]
               If resources.show_all_collections.dropbox=true,
      then the 'show other sites | hide other sites' toggle is present.

      As is the case with dropbox, maintain/instructor type roles see all
      dropboxes. Resources from other sites they participate in will show if
      Show other sites is toggled open. Users with a role that permits them
      to see only their own dropbox will similarly have the toggle to open
      resources from sites they participate in.

      # indicates whether users should see "Show Other Sites" twiggle in
      list mode of file picker

      resources.show_all_collections.helper=true

      The Attachment widget (file picker) changed with 2.1 to include the
      ability to optionally show resources from other sites in which the
      user is a participant when browsing for a file to attach.

      For example, when resources.show_all_collections.helper=true, creating
      an attachment to an Announcement includes resources from other sites
      in the Select a resource section of the attachment page.

                                    [pic]
              The 'Show other sites | hide other sites' toggle

      # worksite setup - enable the ability to control a participant's
      activation in a site

      activeInactiveUser=true

      Used to control whether the 'Active/Inactive' control is available, in
      the list of users that is shown when revising a site via Worksite
      Setup or in Site Info.

                                                                       [pic]


      Some institutions may not want to give site owners the ability to
      inactivate users (such as registered students) due to local policy.
      See also disable.membership.unjoin.selection for a related feature.



wsetup.group.support

      # whether to suppport group in Worksite Setup tool. Default to be true

      wsetup.group.support=true

      Use to hide or show the group support feature in Worksite Setup/Site
      Info tools.
      If wsetup.group.support=true (or not set), Worksite Setup and Site
      Info will show the 'Manage Groups' action in the toolbar.  The Manage
      Groups action will not be shown in Worksite Setup and Site Info if
      wsetup.group.support=false.
                                    [pic]
   The Manage Groups action is shown in Worksite Setup and Site Info tool
                        if wsetup.group.support=true



site.setup.import.file

      # disable from worksite setup the "import file" option

      site.setup.import.file = false

      The toolbar of the Site Info tool can optionally contain an item
      'Import from File'.

      [pic]

      This feature allows one to import site materials from a zip file that
      includes information formatted in a way that Sakai can understand.
      It's basically the Site Archive tool, but in zip format so that
      someone can bring material in from outside of the system.

      Installations will want to hide the Import from File action from the
      toolbar unless they have files available for import (e.g., from their
      legacy system).

      An example of its use: Indiana has built an export zip file from their
      legacy system that contains content zipped into one file. Their users
      can then use the Import from File action to import the zip file
      content.

      See the Worksite Archiving.pdf document in the Sakai Development
      Resources/Configuration docs folder on http://collab.sakaiproject.org
      for more information on archiving in Sakai.

titleEditableSiteType

      # for worksite setup

      titleEditableSiteType.count=1
      titleEditableSiteType.1=project

      Controls end user editing of site titles. Titles of sites with types
      specified by the titleEditableSiteType.n property  can be changed by
      roles with site.upd permission. If a site type is not specified by a
      titleEditableSiteType.n property, the title field on the Edit Site
      Information page is a display only field

      For example, with the default settings shown above, where jlproj777 is
      a project site, and jl20 20 20 is a class site, the following are
      images are from Site Info > Edit Site Information for the two sites.

                                    [pic]

      To allow site title editing for both course and project sites, the
      following settings could be used:
           titleEditableSiteType.count=2
           titleEditableSiteType.1=project
           titleEditableSiteType.2=course



courseSiteType

      courseSiteType=course

      Specifies the type of site that is treated as a 'course' site. For the
      course site type, the term field can be edited with the Admin Sites
      tool. The term field does not show up for other types of sites (e.g.,
      project).

roster.available.weeks.before.term.start


      roster.available.weeks.before.term.start=4

      Controls the flow through Worksite Setup when creating a new course
      site. The value is the number of weeks before start of next term when
      class lists will be presented to instructors for section selection
      when creating class sites. If an instructor creates a class site for
      the next term before roster.available.weeks.before.term.start weeks
      from start of next term, they will not see a list of their assigned
      classes when creating the site. Instead, the flow through Worksite
      Setup has them enter the class information manually.

      This is to prevent the confusion that can arise when instructors
      create class sites too early, when information about teaching
      assignments is still in flux.

      At UM, roster.available.weeks.before.term.start=8
      If an instructor creates a class site 8 weeks before term starts, they
      must enter the class information manually as seen in the following

                                    [pic]

      If the instructor creates a class site 7 weeks before term starts,
      they will see this page instead, which includes a listing of the
      classes they will be teaching for the term.

      termterm.8=SPRING
      termterm.9=SPRING_SUMMER
      termterm.10=SUMMER
      termterm.11=FALL

      Terms (semesters) are known by different names at different
      institutions. This list is where the particular terminology used for
      terms/semesters is specified. The termterm.count value should match
      the number of terms specified by termterm.n entries.

      These values, combined with the tearmyear.n values, are those
      presented in the Term dropdown when creating a class worksite.  Values
      before the current term (based on termendtime) are not shown in the
      list.
                                    [pic]

      Note: Term values for past terms should remain in the various
      termyear.n, termterm.n, termlistabbr.n, etc. lists. Though they may
      not appear in the Term dropdown for selection, they are still needed
      for those class sites that may have been created during the past term.



termyear


      termyear.count=11
      termyear.1=2003
      termyear.2=2004
      termyear.3=2004
      termyear.4=2004
      termyear.5=2004
      termyear.6=2004
      termyear.7=2005
      termyear.8=2005
      termyear.9=2005
      termyear.10=2005
      termyear.11=2005

      termyear specifies the term year for the associated termterm value.
      The termyear.count value should match the number of years specified by
      termyear.n entries.



termlistabbr


      termlistabbr.count=11
      termlistabbr.1=F03
      termlistabbr.2=W04
      termlistabbr.3=Sp04

      termlistabbr.9=SpSu05
      termlistabbr.10=Su05
      termlistabbr.11=F05

      An abbreviation for the term/semester label specified in the
      associated termterm.n property. The abbreviation is used rather than
      the full term name when real estate is at a premium (e.g., in a class
      site title, where 'W05' is used rather than 'Winter 2005'). The
      termlistabbr.count value should match the number of years specified by
      termlistabbr.n entries.



termiscurrent


      termiscurrent.count=11
      termiscurrent.1=false
      termiscurrent.2=false
      termiscurrent.3=false

      termiscurrent.8=true
      termiscurrent.9=false
      termiscurrent.10=false
      termiscurrent.11=false

      termiscurrent specifies which term value shows up as the default in
      the dropdown term list presented when creating a new course worksite.


      At institutions where instructors create their own course sites (as
      opposed to the institution bulk creating a site for every course), the
      course site creation for the next term usually starts sometime before
      the current term ends. Along about the middle of the current term,
      when current term course site creation falls off, it is useful to
      change the default that appears for the term choice in the Term
      dropdown menu to the next term. The termiscurrent.count value should
      match the number of years specified by termiscurrent.n entries.

      Used to control how many characters are allowed in the Subject, Class,
      Section fields when the user manually enters that data during a course
      site setup.
                                    [pic]

noEmailInIdAccountLabel


      noEmailInIdAccountLabel=Username(s)

      Specifies the label of the first entry field on the Add Participants
      page in Worksite Setup and Site Info tools.  The first entry field is
      where provided user account names are entered.
                                    [pic]









noEmailInIdAccountName


emailInIdAccountName


      noEmailInIdAccountName=username
      emailInIdAccountName=guest

      The text to use when referring to the institution affiliated account
      and guest account in alert messages and new account notification
      emails.

      When adding a user with the Add Participants page of Site Info, there
      is a field for two types of user accounts; the institution's
      affiliated account  (username), and the institution's guest type
      account (guest).  The names of these types of accounts can be set
      using   noEmailInIdAccountName and emailInIdAccountName. These names
      are then used in alerts and in the email notification that can
      optionally be sent to new users when they are added to a site.

      For example, the Alert given when Continue is clicked and the entry
      fields are blank on the Add Participants page mentions username and
      guest with the default settings of noEmailInIdAccountName and
      emailInIdAccountName.

      page in Worksite Setup and Site Info tools. The second entry field is
      where non-provided user account names are entered.

                                    [pic]




emailInIdAccountInstru


      emailInIdAccountInstru=To log in, you must first get a guest account.
      A guest account is a special kind of account that is used to give non-
      Sakai University members access to the general Sakai University web
      environment. The Sakai University web environment includes many tools
      and services, one of which is Sakai

      When a new guest account is added via the 2nd entry box on the Add
      Participants page, an email can be sent to the new user notifying them
      that they have been authorized to login to Sakai (see
      notifyNewUserEmail). At institutions where there is an external login
      authority, this message can be used to inform the user that there may
      be some other account creation needed.



emailInIdAccount


      emailInIdAccount.url

      The URL where guests go to get an institution's guest account. The
      value of this property is used in the email message sent to new users
      whose account has been created by entering their email address in the
      2nd entry box on the Add Participants page. See  emailInIdAccount. See
      also notifyNewUserEmail which controls whether new users get an email
      when their account has been created via the Add Participant page.






notifyNewUserEmail


      notifyNewUserEmail=true

      In Sakai, when an external authority is used to grant access, there
      may be two types of users attempting to gain access. Institutional
      users are assumed to have authority to enter Sakai and are let in.
      Guest users, though they may be able to login to the institution's
      system, are not automatically assumed to have authority to enter
      Sakai. A guest account must be authorized to use Sakai.

      When Sakai is handed a user who has a valid institutional guest
      account and has logged in successfully, Sakai has to know whether to
      let the user in - whether the guest user is authorized to use Sakai.

      The authorization is accomplished using a local account in Sakai that
      corresponds to the institutional account. If a local account exists in
      Sakai for a guest user, then that guest user gets all the way in and
      is placed at their My Workspace.

      The Sakai account can be created by support using the Admin User tool.
      But since that takes a support intervention, it's also possible for
      site maintainers to authorize guest accounts to use Sakai. This
      happens automatically when a guest account is entered into the 2nd
      field on the Add Participants page. If the guest account entered there
      doesn't already exist in Sakai, a new user account is created. The
      Sakai account then exists which matches the institution guest account,
      and when the user logs into Sakai via the institution's login
      mechanism, they get all the way into Sakai.

      When an account is created in Sakai, the account has a password. In
      the scenario above, the Sakai account password isn't used - it is the
      guest account/pwd setup with the institution that the guest user signs
      on with. It is just the account name in Sakai that is used to
      authorize the guest user. So in that case, the Sakai password is not
      used, and the user doesn't need to know it. The notifyNewUserEmail
      property should be set to false in that case, so the user doesn't get
      an email with the (not used) Sakai password in it.

      When would you set notifyNewUserEmail=true?  For installations where
      there is no external authorization mechanism (e.g.,
      http://collab.sakaiproject.org), the local Sakai account password is
      used. The Sakai account/pwd is the only means used to log in to Sakai.
      If a user is added to a site and doesn't already have a Sakai account,
      a new account is created. Setting notifyNewUserEmail=true causes an
      email to be sent to the new user informing them of their password.
      Otherwise, they would have a new account and no one would know the
      password. They couldn't login without support getting involved and
      changing their password to some known value, emailing them, etc.



invalidEmailInIdAccountString


      invalidEmailInIdAccountString=nowhere.org

      Though the guest account must be an email address, it must not contain
      this string.

      For example, at UM, guest accounts must be email addresses, and cannot
      contain umich.edu (since if they have a umich.edu email address, they
      must have a UM uniqname and therefore a regular UM account). This is a
      way of preventing mistakes - site maintainers cannot add a guest
      account which contains umich.edu because we have
      invalidEmailInIdAccountString=umich.edu



Sites tool control


sitebrowser.termsearch.type


      sitebrowser.termsearch.type=course

      In the Sites tool commonly placed on the Gateway site (site.browser),
      searches for sites can be constrained by a particular semester/term.
      This property specifies which type of site can be constrained by term
      when searching.

                                    [pic]
          The term constraint shows up for course site types in the
             Sites tool when sitebrowser.termsearch.type=course

                                    [pic]




sitebrowser.termsearch.property


      sitebrowser.termsearch.property=term

      Defines the name of the property that is used to constrain searches on
      sites of type sitebrowser.termsearch.type when searching using the
      Sites tool.



sitesearch.noshow.sitetype


      sitesearch.noshow.sitetype=

      Used to specify the types of sites which shouldn't be shown as a
      search option in the Site Browser tool. The default is to not prevent
      any type from being shown (all types are shown).

      At UM, the setting is sitesearch.noshow.sitetype=GradTools as we don't
      allow users to search through GradTools sites. If you wanted to keep
      project sites from showing up as a search option in the Site Browser
      tool, you could set sitesearch.noshow.sitetype=project.  The value
      matches a site type that exists in your installation.

mail.support

      # email for support (contact support tool only)

      #mail.support=

      An early version of the Help tool (sakai.contactSupport) included a
      'contact support' form that emailed the content of the form to the
      email address set by the mail.support property.

      This is not used in the newer Help system.



setup.request

      # email address which is used in notification emails for requested
      site.

      setup.request=

      When a class site is created, email can be sent to the support
      organization notifying them of the site creation. When a class site is
      created by manually entering course information rather than by
      selecting a class from the list of classes presented to the user,
      support may need to manually add the provider id. Setting
      setup.request to the support email address gives support notice that
      such a site has been created and that there may need to be some manual
      processing to link the roster to the class site.

Membership tool


disable.membership.unjoin.selection

      #Disable the unjoin link in membership tool

      disable.membership.unjoin.selection=

      Before 2.1, a site that is not joinable could be unjoined with the
      Membership tool. The availability of unjoin for such sites caused
      problems to users who unjoined by mistake as they couldn't rejoin.

      However, there is also the desire to allow someone to unjoin a project
      site they might have been added to which they don't want to belong.

      The disable.membership.unjoin.selection= property allows institutions
      to set their own policy. If set to true, then users cannot unjoin
      sites (the unjoin action is not shown in the Membership tool). If set
      to false, users can unjoin sites.

Automatic User Adds - 'Affiliates'


affiliatesubjects.count


affiliatesubjects.n

      # course affiliates

      affiliatesubjects.count=
      affiliatesubjects.1=

      Until hierarchy comes to Sakai, using the affiliatesubjects.count and
      related properties is a way to automatically add certain users to
      sites with certain subject codes.  This is useful if you have support
      personnel in the field at the unit level. All subject codes for that
      unit can be specified along with the user accounts that should be
      added to the site whenever a class site is created that contains one
      of the subject codes.

      For example, if the College of Pharmacy has the subject codes of
      INTERHUM, INTERNS, and INTERSS, the following would define the subject
      codes which, if present in a provider id for a class site, would cause
      associated user accounts to be added to the site.

       # course affiliates
       affiliatesubjects.count=1
       affiliatesubjects.1=INTERHUM,INTERNS,INTERSS

      Which accounts get added are specified with the affiliateuniqnames
      properties.

      Affiliates are added during the class site creation process if the
      site is created 'automatically'. When a class site is created, if the
      creator is the instructor of record, they can pick the class from a
      list of their classes presented. In that case, since the list comes
      from the Registrar, they are known to be authorized to see the roster,
      and the provider id can be automatically attached to the site. At that
      point, affiliates are added as participants, with the Affiliate role.

      If the class site creator isn't the instructor of record, the class
      does not show up in their class list, and they must enter the class
      info manually. Support will vet the request, and if valid (creator has
      the right to create the class site and see the roster), support will
      add the provider id (using the Admin Realm tool). At that point, when
      the provider id is added manually, support must add affiliates
      manually to the site as participants with the Affiliate role.

      Note:  Another mechanism is being tested at UM in CTools, whereby
      affiliates are added via the provider id watcher. The watcher notices
      whenever a provider id changes (either via Worksite Setup or the Admin
      Realm tool). This insures Affiliates are added when support personnel
      add the provider id for a manually created class site. Check the
      CTools branch if you are interested in this code.

      Institutions using the affiliate add mechanisms should also insure
      that the Affiliate role exists in the !site.template and/or
      !site.template.course realms.

      The affiliatesubjects.count value should match the number of years
      specified by affiliatesubjects.n entries.

      See appendix B for examples when there are more than one
      affiliatesubjects.n  property.



affiliatecampus.count


affiliatecampus.n


      affiliatecampus.count=
      affiliatecampus.1=

      Used to specify a particular campus for an affiliate. The
      affiliatecampus.count property specifies the number of affiliatecampus
      values.

      For example, at UM, the College of Pharmacy is on the Ann Arbor campus
      (designated as 'A'), and we would use the following to go along with
      the affiliatesubject property example used above.

       affiliatecampus.count=1
       affiliatecampus.1=A

      The affiliatecampus.count value should match the number of years
      specified by affiliatecampus.n entries.

      See appendix B for examples when there are more than one
      affiliatecampus.n  property.


affiliateuniqnames.count


affiliateuniqnames.n


      affiliateuniqnames.count=
      affiliateuniqnames.1=

      affiliateuniqnames.n  specifies the user account names that will be
      added when class sites with the subject codes specified in
      affiliatesubjects.n  on the campus affiliatecampus.n are created.

      For example, the settings below insure the accounts peterwolf and
      abester are added to class sites created on the Ann Arbor campus with
      subject codes of INTERHUM, INTERNS, or INTERSS given the property
      settings shown in the examples for affiliateuniqnames and
      affiliatesubjects.

       affiliateuniqnames.count=1
       affiliateuniqnames.1=petewolf, abester

      The affiliateuniqnames.count value should match the number of years
      specified by affiliateuniqnames.n entries.

      See appendix B for examples when there are more than one
      affiliateuniqnames.n  property.



GradTools

The GradTool is not currently used at many institutions other than UM.
Values are included for completeness.


withDissertation


      withDissertation=

      Specifies whether GradTools shows up as a site type option when
      creating sites in Worksite Setup. When set to true, a user creating a
      site will see class, project, and dissertation as options when
      creating a site. However, they well only see dissertation as an option
      if they are in the PhD program at the institution, and have not yet
      created their GradTools site.







gradToolsSiteType.count


gradToolsSiteType.n

      # gradtools site types

      gradToolsSiteType.count=
      gradToolsSiteType.1=

      Specifies the types of sites used by GradTools.  For example, at UM,
      we have

           gradToolsSiteType.count=3
           gradToolsSiteType.1=GradToolsStudent
           gradToolsSiteType.2=GradToolsRackham
           gradToolsSiteType.3=GradToolsDepartment
