Authentication is a Sakai kernel service that has the responsibility of
authenticating end users.  A package of "evidence" is collected that
represents information provided by the end user.  This is validated against
the authentication "database".  A valid authentication produces an end user
id (UUID) to be considered the authorized end user.

Authentication API is implemented by one of many different components.
Authentication is likely to be tied into a Sakai integrator's enterprise
systems, so we expect many different forms of Authentication components for
Sakai.

There are also going to be many forms of Authentication evidence.  This
will often take the form of a user identification and a password.  Another
form of evidence will be the "remote user" from a web server that is
participating with a container based single-sign-on system, which we have
chosen to trust for our authentication.  Evidence can also take the form of
a public certificate, a thumbprint, or any other sort of information that
is used to authentication a user.

Authentication is a lonely API.  There are going to be very few clients of
the API.

The Authentication API is defined in the Sakai kernel module, in the
authentication project.
