<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I order the questions in
my assessment?
</h2>

<p>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  On the Assessments page, click the title of
the assessment you wish to work on. You'll see a list of questions for
that assessment. For each question, from the "Question" drop-down
list, select the numerical order in which you'd like that question to
appear. For example, if you'd like a question to be the third
question, select <strong><code>3</code></strong>. Your questions will be automatically
sorted.</p>
