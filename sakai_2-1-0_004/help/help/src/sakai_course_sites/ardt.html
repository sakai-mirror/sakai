<h2>Sakai 2.0 course and project sites: Overview
</h2>
	  <h3>What they are</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Course sites:</strong> A course site is the official work
site for a particular academic course for an institution, and can be
linked to a database (such as a registrar's) to
automatically populate its roster.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Project sites:</strong> Project sites are designed to
facilitate collaboration. You can invite anyone you wish to join
your project site.

</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a web browser, you can choose from features and
functions to create course and project sites that meet your
needs. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>A course website where students can electronically work on and
submit assignments <br><br>
</li>
<li>A website where an instructor or project director can make
announcements and share resources, such as electronic documents or
links to other websites<br><br>
</li>
<li>A website that serves as an online discussion board
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> No knowledge of HTML is
necessary.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>My Workspace:</strong> When you log in, you will
automatically open a site called My Workspace. All users
get their own My Workspace site.</p>

<p><strong>Tabs:</strong> You may also see tabs for one or more course
or project sites, depending on how many sites you belong to or
create. If you are a member of more than four or five sites, you'll
find them in the <strong><code>More</code></strong> drop-down menu.</p>

<p><strong>Menubar:</strong> Course sites and project sites can have
just a few or several functions (including announcements, a schedule,
an online discussion area, assignments, electronic resources, a chat
area, and more). When you create a site, you choose which tools to
include, and they are added to the menubar along the left
side of the screen. To access a tool, click its name in the
menubar.</p>

<p>Sites also have a "homepage", which you can access by
clicking <strong><code>Home</code></strong> in the menubar.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
