<h2>Sakai 2.0 Web Content: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>The Web Content tool allows site owners to choose external websites to
display within their worksite.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Links:</strong> To set up Web Content links, you can
specify the URL for any website, and a brief descriptive
title. A link will appear in the menubar with the title
you've chosen; when you click the link, the website will open within
your worksite. You may add multiple Web Content links to your menubar.

</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you want to provide many links to websites for your course or
project participants, you can avoid cluttering your menubar by listing
most of them in the Resources section.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>Departments, collaborations, or other groups may use the Web Content
tool to provide a prominent link to their public worksite.</li>
</ul>
