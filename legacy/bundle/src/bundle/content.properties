If you want to copy several files or an entire folder all at once, software called WebDAV can be used to drag files or folders from your local computer to or from the Resources folder in Sakai.
dav.graf11   = Several setup steps are required to make your computer aware of Sakai so it will treat the Sakai Resources folder as another folder on your computer. Once you have set up a particular Sakai class or group resource folder using WebDAV, you can drag files and folders to the class or group Resource area from your local computer and vice versa. Please note that these connections are specific to the computer you are using, so if you change computers you will have to set up the connection again.
