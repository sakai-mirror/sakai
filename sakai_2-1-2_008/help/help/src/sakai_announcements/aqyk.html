<h2>Sakai 2.0 Announcements: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Announcements tool is used to inform site participants about
current items of interest. Announcements can have multiple
attachments, such as documents or URLs.</p>

<p>To see the Announcements from all the sites to which you belong, in
the menubar of My Workspace, click <strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Sorting:</strong> Announcements can be sorted by subject,
sender, access, or date.</p>

<p><strong>Posting:</strong> Announcements are posted to a course or
project site. Site owners and instructors can choose to have an
announcement automatically sent via email to all site participants by
using the "required" or "high" notification setting.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>Announcements are a useful way to post a notice about an important
change in deadlines, meeting times, or meeting locations.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>You can draft and save an announcement before you send it out to
site participants. Your drafts will be shown with a "Draft" marker
in your list of announcements.
