<h3>Binary Overview:</h3>
<p>The Binary Installation of
Sakai provides a shortcut for those that already have Tomcat in place
and configured as needed, and it does so by providing a pre-built Sakai
that can simply be dropped into Tomcat as an
overlay.</p>
<p>All you need to do is unzip the Binary archive from within the top
Tomcat
directory (e.g. $CATALINA_HOME). The appropriate wars, jars, etc., will
be deposited in the correct locations, as the structure of the archive
maps to the file structure of Tomcat.</p>
<h3>Configuration:</h3>
<p>If you wish to configure your
Sakai installation you'll still need to manually create a 'sakai'
directory in $CATALINA_HOME to hold your *.properties files (i.e. the
binary installation doesn't include this). &nbsp;On a Unix system,
for example,</p>
<pre>mkdir $CATALINA_HOME/sakai</pre>
<p>For more configuration
information see the <a href="SourceInstallGuide.html">Source Install
Guide</a>.
