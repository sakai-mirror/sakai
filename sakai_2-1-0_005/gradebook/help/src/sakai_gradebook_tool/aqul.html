<h2>Overriding an autocalculated course grade</h2>

<p>By default, a course grade is automatically calculated by the
Gradebook. This grade is simply calculated as a percentage of current
points scored out of the total points possible of all assignments
entered in the Gradebook. Therefore, if there are ungraded assignments
present, the autocalculated course grade may not always be
accurate. You can choose to manually override the course grade or use
the autocalculated grade.</p>

<h3>Override an autocalculated course grade</h3>

<p>To override an autocalculated course grade, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are
not already on the Overview page of the Gradebook tool, click
<strong><code>Overview</code></strong> near the top of the window.<br><br>
</li>
<li>At the bottom of the assignment list, click <strong><code>Course
Grade</code></strong>.<br><br>

</li>
<li>On the resulting page, you will see a list of enrolled students
and their calculated course grades. In the "Grade Override" column,
enter the new course grade(s) with which you want to replace the
autocalculated grade(s).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When manually entering a course grade, you must
use the appropriate grade type for the Gradebook in which you are
working. For example, if the course is graded on a simple letter grade
scale, you will only be able to enter the letters
<code>&nbsp;A&nbsp;</code>, <code>&nbsp;B&nbsp;</code>,
<code>&nbsp;C&nbsp;</code>, <code>&nbsp;D&nbsp;</code>, or
<code>&nbsp;F&nbsp;</code>. If the course is graded on a standard
letter grade scale, you will also be able to add
<code>&nbsp;+&nbsp;</code> (plus sign) or <code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</code>

(minus sign) to the letter grade. If the course is graded on a
pass/fail scale, you will only be able to enter the letters
<code>&nbsp;P&nbsp;</code> or <code>NP&nbsp;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>When you have finished updating any course grades you want to
change, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Revert back to an autocalculated course grade</h3>

<p>If you have overridden a course grade, and you want to use the
autocalculated course grade instead, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>. If you are not already
on the Overview page of the Gradebook tool, click <strong><code>Overview</code></strong>
near the top of the window.<br><br>
</li>
<li>At the bottom of the assignment list, click <strong><code>Course
Grade</code></strong>.<br><br>
</li>

<li>On the resulting page, you will see a list of enrolled
students. If you have overridden a course grade for a student, you
will see the grade you manually entered in an editable field in the
"Grade Override" column. To revert back to the autocalculated course
grade, delete the manually entered grade and click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will have to delete the manually entered
grade and click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> for each grade you want to change back.</p>
</li>
</ol>
