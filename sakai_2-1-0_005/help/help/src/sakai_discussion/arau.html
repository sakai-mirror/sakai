<h2>In Sakai 2.0, how do I post a discussion item
(topic or reply) previously saved as a draft?
</h2>

	  <p>To post a discussion item (e.g., topic or reply) that you previously
saved as a draft, follow these steps:
</p><ol>
<li>In your site's menubar, click <strong><code>Discussion</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the list of discussion items, click the black triangles to
expand the categories and topics as needed. Find your draft posting,
which will have "Draft -" in front of the title and will occupy the
same place in the discussion hierarchy as the eventual posting.

<br><br>
</li>

<li>Click the draft title to open the message.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Make any necessary edits and then click <strong><code>Add Reply</code></strong>. You
will be able to tell it was posted because the title will no longer
have "Draft-" in front of it.
</li>
</ol>
