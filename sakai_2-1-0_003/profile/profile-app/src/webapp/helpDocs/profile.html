<H2>What is my Sakai Profile?</H2>

<H3>What it does</H3>
<P>When you first log into Sakai, you begin in your Profile, which is
essentially your Sakai home page. It contains your basic contact information
and also serves as your entry point into your courses. Your Profile
also contains resources and tools that are generally useful but not
associated with a particular course or academic subject.</P>

<H3>Key concepts</H3>

<P><STRONG>Contact information:</STRONG> Your Profile initially displays
your first and last names. All other details are optional. If you
choose to include certain kinds of &quot;protected&quot; information, such as a
picture <A HREF="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/adnz.html?cust=170670.11812.30">URL</A> (<A HREF="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/adpn.html?cust=170670.11812.30">GIF</A> or <A HREF="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/adqe.html?cust=170670.11812.30">JPEG</A>), an email address, home page URL, or phone
number, you can specify who can see them: course authors only,
students in your class, or guest visitors to Sakai.</P>
<P> <STRONG>Course listings:</STRONG> Ordinarily, your Profile
displays your courses for the current semester. You can also customize
this display to include courses from past semesters. (Your courses are
those in which you are registered as a student, listed with your
department as faculty of record, or to which you have been added
manually by the faculty of record or by another course author.)</P>
<P> <STRONG>File Manager:</STRONG> The File Manager is probably the
most important of the tools available from the Profile. It is a place
where you can upload and store files, including essays, articles,
images, sound files, presentations, and other documents. Ordinarily,
files that you transfer to the File Manager are publicly accessible
from the Web. If you prefer to keep some files private, you can move
them to a private folder.</P>
<P> <STRONG>General tools:</STRONG> The resources provided under &quot;My
Tools&quot; also include a notebook where you can jot down general comments
or other items, a bookmarks page for saving your favorite Web links, a
calendar displaying scheduled items for your courses, and links to a
variety of university resources such as <A HREF="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/afih.html?cust=170670.11812.30">Insite</A> and campus maps. If you
are a course author, you can also access Faculty Tools from your
Profile.</P>
<H3>Things to consider</H3>
<UL><LI>Your calendar contains every dated item from any of your courses,
as well as any personal material you choose to add.<BR CLEAR="NONE"><BR CLEAR="NONE">
  </LI><LI>Since anything you transfer to the File Manager is publicly
accessible from the Web unless you put it in a private folder, the
File Manager can function as personal Web space as well as extra file
storage.</LI></UL>
