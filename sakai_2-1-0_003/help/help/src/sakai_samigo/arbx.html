<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, what is a question pool?
</h2>
	  
<p>Assessment creators can organize questions into question pools so
that they and other instructors can reuse them. Question pools can be
subdivided into subpools to organize questions by subject matter,
section number, question type, or any other criteria desired. For
example, an instructor can create a question pool called "Biology
105", and then create subpools called "Basic concepts", "Cell
biology", and "Genetics".</p>

<p>The creator of the question pool can designate who is able to view,
copy, edit, add, or remove questions in the pool or subpools. </p>
