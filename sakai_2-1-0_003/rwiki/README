Sakai RWiki for Sakai 2
-----------------------

The provided war should be installed as sakai-rwiki.war in the webapps folder of a 
sakai tomcat instance.

How to Build
------------

There are several ways to build this project. The simplest is to do:

maven sakai

This should build and deploy the webapp to the correct place in your local sakai 
instance.

The other options are to build the following sub-projects separately: 
radeox, jrcs, rwiki-service, and rwiki. Their default goals should be enough.
Finally you would have to install the war created by the rwiki sub-project in
your sakai-tomcat folder as sakai-rwiki.war

Known Issues
------------

1. To install math support you should set the init-params headerScriptSrc and
footerScript appropriately. We recommend that you keep these as the default and
install an appropriate library in /library/jsMath. We suggest that you use
jsMath (http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/welcome.html) but cannot
distribute it as it is GPL.

2. Searching is restricted to the default permission realm, and doesn't check
that the pages returned can actually be viewed by the searcher.

3. We are currently missing functionality to provide for permission realm
changes to pages, and renaming of pages.

4. There are very few unit-tests for this code, some more should be written. A
similar statement applies for javadoc comments.
