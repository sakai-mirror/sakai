This directory contains a sample Kerberos UserDirectoryProvider.

It (and its derivatives) are in use at a few institutions, but you
should review the code and test it accordingly.

Instructions for installing and configuring the provider can be found
in the "docs" directory. The INSTALL.txt file is the place to start.
