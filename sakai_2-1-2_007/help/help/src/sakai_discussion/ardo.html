<h2>Sakai 2.0 Discussion: Overview
</h2>
	  <h3>What it does</h3>

<p>Discussion allows structured conversations that are organized into
categories. Site participants can post replies to a topic (a "flat"
discussion) or to other replies (a "threaded" discussion). A site's
owner can also choose whether or not to allow site participants to
post their own discussion topics.</p>

<p>You may view Discussion in a row or column layout. This is a personal
preference and changes only your view of the Discussion.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>
<strong>Categories and topics:</strong> Categories are the top
level in the Discussion tool. Topics appear under the categories,
and replies appear grouped with the appropriate topic.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Deleting:</strong> The absence of a trash can icon means that
you do not have permission to delete a discussion item. Only site
maintainers, instructors, and others with special permissions can
delete discussion items.
</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>When posting a topic, you can limit replies to only the top-level
post (i.e., your initial post), or you can allow replies to any
posts. If you limit postings, then you create a "flat" discussion. If,
on the other hand, you allow replies to any posting, then you create a
"threaded" discussion. Threaded discussions are by nature more
interactive because users are able to reply to a reply. Flat
discussions, in contrast, tend to be more structured and for this
reason are more easily controlled.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>Many collaboration sites allow any site participant to start a
discussion topic, which facilitates a more collegial discussion
environment.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Some classes use categories like "Homework Questions" and "Exam
Review" to structure their Discussion feature. Others create
categories for course concepts.</li>
</ul>
