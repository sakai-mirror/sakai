<a name="intro"></a><h3>Introduction</h3>

WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows
users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers.

<a name="mycomp"></a><h3>Using My Network Places</h3>

<p>To access files in Resources  using WebDAV
via <strong><code>My Network Places</code></strong>, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>On the desktop, double-click <strong><code>My Network Places</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the <strong><code>Network Tasks</code></strong> pane, click <strong><code>Add a network
place</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>When the Add Network Place Wizard appears, click <strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br><br>

</li>
<li>Select <strong><code>Choose another network location</code></strong> and then click
<strong><code>Next</code></strong>. In the "Internet or network address:" field, enter
the appropriate text:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>If you know the correct URL, you can connect to your personal resource
space by entering it into the "Internet or network address"
field. Contact your site administrator for the URL's format; it will
likely include your username.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Similarly, you can connect to the Resources for a specific course,
  and upload and download files to and from Resources, if you know the
  correct URL and the unique site ID number. The ID number is the sequence of
  numbers appearing immediately at the end of your site's URL. For
  example, once you have clicked the tab for a particular site, the
  URL field in your web browser will contain something similar to
  this: 
https://oncoursecl.iu.edu/portal/site/123456789-123

<p>The site ID in this case would be <code>123456789-123</code>. To
  save a site ID number, while you are in the site, click
  <strong><code>File</code></strong>, then either <strong><code>Save as...</code></strong> or <strong><code>Save page
  as...&#160;</code></strong>. Make sure the site ID number is in the "File
  name:" field, and then save it to a place where you can easily
  retrieve it.  </p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<p>
You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
Resources to which you just connected. However, you cannot delete
items in the Resources by dragging them to the Recycle Bin on your
desktop. To delete an item, right-click it and select <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>.
</p>

<a name="ie"></a><h3>Internet Explorer</h3>

<p>
You can also use Internet Explorer to open your files in Oncourse CL
as a Web folder via WebDAV. Follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, from the <strong><code>File</code></strong> menu, select
<strong><code>Open...&#160;</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the window that appears, click the checkbox next to <strong><code>Open
as Web folder</code></strong>. In the "Open:" field, enter the appropriate text:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>If you know the correct URL, you can connect to your personal resource
space by entering it into the "Internet or network address"
field. Contact your site administrator for the URL's format; it will
likely include your username.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Similarly, you can connect to the Resources for a specific course,
  and upload and download files to and from Resources, if you know the

  save a site ID number, while you are in the site, click
  <strong><code>File</code></strong>, then either <strong><code>Save as...</code></strong> or <strong><code>Save page

  name:" field, and then save it to a place where you can easily
  retrieve it.  </p>

</li>
</ul>

<br>
</li>
<li>The contents of the resources folder will appear in a window where
you can open individual files, browse to other folders on your
computer, and transfer files between folders.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>When you're finished, close the browser.
</li>
</ol>
