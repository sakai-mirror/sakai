<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I add questions to a
    question pool or subpool?
</h2>

<p>To add questions to a question pool or subpool, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  
<br><br>
</li>
<li>From the Assessments page, click <strong><code>Question Pools</code></strong>.<br><br>

</li>
<li>From the main Question Pools screen, click the name of the
question pool to which you want to add the questions. If you'd like to
add questions to a subpool, first reveal the name of the subpool by
clicking on the triangle next to the larger pool. Then, click the name
of the subpool.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>On the bar labeled "# Questions", where "#" is the number of
questions in the pool or subpool, click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>From the drop-down menu beside "Select question type", select the
question type. Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The precise options on the next screen will depend upon the type
of question you are adding. Typically, you will indicate a point value
for the question, the question text, correct answer(s), and feedback
for correct or incorrect answers. 
</li>
<li>To add the question to the pool or subpool, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>You will be returned to the main screen for your question pool or
subpool. Under the question you just added, you can click <strong><code>Preview</code></strong>
to preview the question.

<br><br>
</li>

<li>Click <strong><code>Add</code></strong> if you wish to add another question, and repeat
the steps above. When you are finished, click <strong><code>Update</code></strong>.

</li>

<br><br>

<li>You can also add a question to a question pool when you create a new
 question in an assessment. Follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Create a new assessment.
</li>
<li>
Create a new question in the assessment.
</li>
<li>
Before saving the new question, find the "Assign to Question Pool"
field.
</li>
<li>
Click the drop-down arrow to show the list of Question Pools, and
select the Question Pool that you want to add this question to.
</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
NOTE: When you add a question to a question pool while creating an
 assessment, and then later modify the question in the assessment, the
question in the question pool is also modified.
