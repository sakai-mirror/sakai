<h2>In Sakai 2.0, what is the reset button?
</h2>

<p>There is a small button that appears to the left of the name of the
tool you're using. This button is called the reset button.</p>

<p>Use the reset button to return to the starting point of 
any tool, as if you had entered the tool in a new session. </p>
