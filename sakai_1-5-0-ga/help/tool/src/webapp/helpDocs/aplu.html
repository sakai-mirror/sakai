<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>Resources is the most widely used feature in classes and
collaborations. In Resources, you can make many kinds of material
available online. There are three types of resources: documents (e.g.,
word processing documents, spreadsheets, slide presentations, plain
text), links to other websites, and simple text documents that display
right on the page.</p>

<p>You can post up to 10 resources at a time, post items outside of
folders, create folders inside other folders, and create HTML
documents.</p>

<p>Using the Permissions feature, site owners can control which types of
users can post, delete, and read documents in specific folders. Site
owners and instructors can make a resource available to anyone by
choosing to post it with the "public view" setting checked.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>
<p>Once you click <strong>Resources</strong> in the menubar, you will see a list
of the resources and/or folders containing resources. Click a
resource's title to open it, or click the folder icon next to the folder
name or the name itself to open a folder.</p>

<p>You can sort the resources by title (click <strong>Title</strong>), size
(click <strong>Size</strong>), the resource creator (click <strong>Created
by</strong>), and when the resources were last modified (click <strong>Last
modified</strong>). To reverse the order, click any of these links again. </p>

<p>You can navigate between resources and folders using the breadcrumbs
above the resource list; simply click a folder name in the breadcrumb
line. You can also click the icon of a folder with an arrow in it to
go up one level.</p>
 
<p>For information about a resource, click the <strong> i </strong>
icon next to the resource.  This shows you the size of the file, who
posted it and when, and the date it was last modified. It also provides a
direct link to the resource.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>Many classes post weekly readings in their Resources. These can
include links to websites as well as to other kinds of documents, like
Adobe PDF files. Some classes also post presentations or slides used
in lectures.

</li><li>Using Permissions, a large collaboration site can use one folder
in Resources as a space to archive important documents, and allow only
certain site participants to modify those documents.</li></ul>
