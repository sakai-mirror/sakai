<strong>Note:</strong> Even though it is possible for you as faculty
to sign up for an official Oncourse CL course site for your
spring 2005 course, it is important to realize that some features
currently in Oncourse Classic, such as the gradebook and assessment tool,
will not be available in Oncourse CL until the official release in
June 2005.  For this reason, UITS strongly recommends that
you spend the spring semester familiarizing yourself with the
application by instead requesting a project site, which
contains the same tools as an official course site. (See the Knowledge
Base document For Oncourse CL, how do I request a project site?)
</p>


<h3>Official course sites</h3>

<p>
Official course sites are those recognized by the Office of the
Registrar.  If you are an instructor, you can sign up to deliver your
spring 2005 course in Oncourse CL, rather than in the old
Oncourse system (Oncourse Classic); however, UITS does not recommend
that you do so (see above Note).
</p><p>
Once you sign up for an official course site in Oncourse CL for spring
2005, the link to the course that currently exists in your Oncourse
Profile will be redirected to Oncourse CL. Likewise, your students
will see the link for your course in their Oncourse Profiles, but that
link will go to the new Oncourse CL site.
</p><h3>Project sites</h3>

<p>
Project sites contain the same tools as official course sites. Anyone
with a valid Indiana University Network ID can request a
project site, which you can then use for collaborating on a project or
committee, or simply to practice using Oncourse CL. Instructors may
wish to create a project site to practice putting course content into
Oncourse CL, while still being able to deliver spring 2005 courses in
Oncourse Classic.
</p><p>
If you sign up for a project site in Oncourse CL, a link for the site
will appear in your course list on your Oncourse Profile page. The
site will be available for use one business day after you request it.
