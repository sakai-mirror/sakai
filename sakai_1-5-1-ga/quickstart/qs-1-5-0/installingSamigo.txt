To activate Samigo in the Sakai 1.5 Quickstart perform the following
steps.  

Note that all files are stored relative to the directory in which the
Quickstart was unzipped. The literal $PWD below should be changed to
the path to that directory appropriate for your installation.

A) Register Samigo

1 - Copy the contents of the directory $PWD/localfiles/reg.samigo to the
$PWD/localfiles/reg directory. 


B) Manually Install the war file

Installation of the war file is manual because we need to customize some
information in the war file.

1 - Rename the $PWD/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/webapps/samigo.war.hide file to
$PWD/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/webapps/samigo.war.

2 - Go to the $PWD/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/webapps directory, create a samigo
directory, copy the samigo.war file into the samigo directory, go to that 
directory and run 'jar xf samigo.war'.  The war file is installed manually because of the
next step.

C) Update the webapp information. 

Note that using the forward slash ('/') in these file names will work on Windows as 
well as on Unix based operating systems.  Using the backwards slash ('\') in properties files can cause problems.

1 - Change the value starting with 'file:' in
$PWD/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/webapps/samigo/WEB-INF/classes/org/sakaiproject/spring/applicationContext.xml
to be the location of the samigo.xml file:
$PWD/localfiles/opt/sa_forms/java/dev/org/sakaiproject/security/sam/samigo.xml

2 - In the
$PWD/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/webapps/samigo/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml file
change the value of the PathToSecurity parameter to point to the value
"$PWD/localfiles/opt/sa_forms/java/dev".
 
3 - In the
$PWD/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/webapps/samigo/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml file
change the value of the PathToSettings parameter value to be
"$PWD/localfiles/opt/j2ee/dev".


D) Configure Samigo database access

1 - Change the values in
$PWD/localfiles/opt/sa_forms/java/dev/org/sakaiproject/security/sam/samigo.xml
to be appropriate for your Oracle installation.

2 - Make sure an appropriate Oracle driver is installed in
$PWD/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/common/lib.

3- Create the required tables in your Oracle database by running 
   the following ddl files via SQLPlus in this order.
   i.  01_schema_oracle.sql which contains SQL statement for creating all the 
       required tables and sequence, please be sure to commit.
   ii. 02_defaultSetUp_oracle.sql which contains SQL statements for populating 
       basic information (such as Type and  a Default Template) required for 
       running Samigo

Both files are located inside $PWD/localfiles/ddl/samigo-ddl/. You may
want to capture the output to check that all the tables and sequence
are created accordingly.  There may be errors around deleting elements that 
don't exist.  These errors are harmless and don't indicate a problem.

Samigo should then be available as the Quiz and Test tool can be
placed in sites via Worksite Setup.
