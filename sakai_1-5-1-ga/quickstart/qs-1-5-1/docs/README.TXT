Welcome to the 1.5.1 release of Sakai.  In addition to numerious bug fixes the 
QuickSource distribution is designed to make it easier to create a version of Sakai
customized to your installation environment.  The QuickDemo (formerly QuickStart) 
distribution is appropriate for initial exploration of Sakai.For production we 
recommend using the QuickSource distribution or using the source
directly from the CVS repository. 

The documentation files for this release of the Sakai QuickSource distribution can
be found in the docs directory.  The source for Sakai is in the sakai directory.
The source for Samigo is found in the sam directory.  Sakai and Samigo are found 
in different directories as they require different build environments.
