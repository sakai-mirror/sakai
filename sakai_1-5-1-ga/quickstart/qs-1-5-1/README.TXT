This directory contains tools to create  QuickDemo and QuickStart distributions of 
Sakai.  They rely on Ant as much as possible in order to be platform agnostic, but
when that is not possible they use bash scripts.

It also has scripts to build up a tar file for the release website and constains some 
information that would be specific to an installation.  E.g. a preconfigured instance 
of the hsqldb database.
