Running the gradebook on the Sun JSF 1.1_01 Implementation

The gradebook will build and run using either the gradebook's "default" choice,
the myfaces core jsf implementation, or on Sun's 1.1_01 implementation.
Regardless of which jsf core implementation you choose, the gradebook does
depend on the myfaces add-on extensions library, which provides features such
as sortable tables and other goodies.  In order to use the Sun implementation,
there are several build and configuration changes that must be made to the
gradebook and the supporting sakaix jsf tag library.

1) gb/tool/project.xml: Uncomment the section labeled "Sun JSF support" and
modify the "MyFaces JSF support" section to look like this:

		<dependency>
			<groupId>myfaces</groupId>
			<artifactId>myfaces-extensions</artifactId>
			<version>1.0.9</version>
			<properties>
				<war.bundle>true</war.bundle>
			</properties>
		</dependency>

You need to make sure that the myfaces-extensions.jar (which is included in the
binary download from http://myfaces.apache.org) is available in a maven
repository that is available to the gradebook during build time, and that is has
been renamed to myfaces-extensions-1.0.0.jar (ie append the current version
number you are using to the filename.  It's poor practice to add non-versioned
artifacts to a maven repository).

2) Remove the myfaces listener from web.xml

3) Since the sakai jsf widget set must be build for either sun or myfaces, you
must edit JSFDepends.java in the sakaix jsf widget project, rebuild the project,
and ensure that the gradebook is build referencing the new jar.  I renamed the
jar sakai-jsf-widget-sun-sakai.2.0.0.jar to keep a distinction between the
default myfaces build and the sun build, and updated the gradebook's project.xml
to reference this new sakaix artifact.

4) It appears that the Sun RI has the same bug that myfaces just fixed regarding
the "percentage" attribute of the f:convertNumber tag.  Update all uses of this
tag in the gradebook to use the incorrect "percent" attribute.
