<h2>Exporting scores from the Gradebook</h2>

<p>From the Gradebook, you can export your students' scores to a
Microsoft Excel file by their cumulative score for the course and with
the student roster. To export scores from the Gradebook, in the
relevant course site, follow the appropriate steps below:</p>


<h4>Export scores by assignment</h4>

<p>Click the name of the assignment from which you wish to export
scores. At the bottom of the page, click the <strong><code>Export</code></strong>
button. Your Excel file will have your students' names, student IDs,
and scores for the assignment you are viewing. </p>


<h4>Export cumulative scores</h4>

<p>Under the list of assignments, click the <strong><code>Course Grade</code></strong>

link. You will see a course summary with an average score for your
entire class and your grading table. To export your course scores to
Microsoft Excel (<code>.csv</code> format), click the <strong><code>Export for
Excel</code></strong> or the <strong><code>Export CSV</code></strong> button.</p>

<p>The default filename format for your file is
<code>course_grade_[courseID]__date.*</code>. The exported fields and
the names of the Excel column headers are "Student Name", "Student ID",
and "CourseGrade". The full student display names and complete
assignment names are exported. Assignment point values will only
export up to two decimal places. Scores are listed in the assignment
name column.</p>

<h4>Export scores from the student roster</h4>

<p>At the top of the Gradebook, click the <strong><code>Roster</code></strong> link. You will see
your student roster, and <strong><code>Export for Excel</code></strong> and <strong><code>Export
CSV</code></strong> buttons at the bottom of the page. For more information about
exporting scores from the student roster, see help for "Viewing and exporting student roster from the Gradebook".</p>
