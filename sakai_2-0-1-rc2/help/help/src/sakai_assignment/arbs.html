<h3>Create/add a new assignment</h3>

<p>To create/add a new assignment, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>, and then
click <strong><code>New Assignment</code></strong> at the top of the page.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the web form that opens, fill in the following information
(fields marked with a red dot are required):

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Title:</strong> Enter a brief title for your assignment,
e.g., <code>Essay 1&#160;</code>. 

</li>
<li>
<strong>Open date:</strong> At the open date and time, the
assignment is available for students to begin working on it. To send
an announcement alerting students to the start date, see step 4 below.

</li>
<li>
<strong>Due date:</strong> This is the assignment's deadline. To
list the due date on the course site's schedule, see step 4
below.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Accept until:</strong> No assignments can be
submitted after this date. You can set this date and time later than
the due date to continue accepting assignments (e.g., to allow for
revisions) after the due date.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Student submissions:</strong> You can choose to have
students submit their assignments inline only (typed directly into a
text box), as attachments only, or both.

</li>
<li>

<strong>Additional resources:</strong> To add an attached resource
to your assignment, follow these steps:

<br><br>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong>, <strong><code>Add/drop attachments</code></strong>, or
<strong><code>Add/Remove attachments</code></strong>.
</li>
<li>You can add any number of attachments, and they can be any
combination of local files, websites, and resources:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>To attach a local file from your computer, click <strong><code>Local
File...&#160;</code></strong>, and then either enter a filename in the box
provided or click <strong><code>Browse...&#160;</code></strong>. Once you find the file,
select it and click <strong><code>Open</code></strong>, then click <strong><code>Attach</code></strong>, and
finally click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to attach the item(s).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When attaching a file, you must include the
file's extension (e.g., <code>.gif</code>, <code>.doc</code>,

<code>.html</code>, or <code>.jpg</code>). If you do not, anyone who
attempts to display or download the file will get an error
message.</p>
</li>
<li>To attach a URL, click <strong><code>Website URL...&#160;</code></strong>,
and then type the URL in the box provided. Click <strong><code>Attach</code></strong>, and

you leave it blank.  Click <strong><code>Post</code></strong> a second time to proceed.</p>

automatically when you post the assignment with an announcement on
your site's homepage, check the box.
</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Add honor pledge:</code></strong> To display the honor pledge when
students are submitting an assignment, check the box. Students must
check a checkbox agreeing to the pledge before their work can be
submitted. The text of the honor pledge is as follows:

<blockquote><p>"I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment. Yes (You
must respond to submit your assignment.)"</p></blockquote>
