<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, 
can I modify an assessment once it's published?
</h2>
	  
<p>Once you've published an assessment, you <strong>cannot</strong>
add, delete, or modify its questions, but you can change the "Delivery
Dates".  </p>

<p>You cannot revoke a published assessment.  You may, however, change
the "Retract Date" on an assessment so students cannot access it. </p>


<p>You can modify the assessment from "Core Assessments", and then
publish it again. </p>
