<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I manage my
email?
</h2>

<p>Your email messages are stored in the Email Archive, which is
accessible to all participants of your course site or
project site. When you first access the site, if you do not
see the tool <strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong> on the menubar, you
will need to add it. </p>

<h3>Sending messages</h3>

<p>You can send messages to your site's participants from your email
account with your preferred email client (e.g.,
Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora,
Mac OS X Mail, or Thunderbird). All messages
will be stored in the Email Archive and visible to all
participants. To view your site's email address, in the menubar, click
<strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not possible to send email to individual
participants through the site. Messages sent to the site's email
address will go to all participants.</p>

<h3>Receiving messages</h3> 

<p>Messages are sent to the email address in your profile. You do not
need to log into the application to read your mail. However, if you do
not wish to receive mail from the site, or if you'd rather receive
mail in a daily digest format, you can change your notification
preferences from your My Workspace. </p>
