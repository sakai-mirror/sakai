<h2>Sakai 2.0 navigation
</h2>
<p>
Following is a brief overview of features and how to navigate:
</p>

<ul>
<li>My Workspace is your individual online workspace. When you first
log in, you go to My Workspace automatically. To return to your
workspace after visiting other sites, click the <strong><code>MyWorkspace</code></strong>
tab in the upper left corner of the screen.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Course and project sites appear as tabs across the top of the
screen. Click a tab to go to the corresponding site. Course sites are
associated with courses; project sites are for projects and other
collaborative activities.


<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If you are not yet a member of any course or
project site, you will see only a My Workspace tab. 
</p>
</li>
<li>The menubar is a column along the left side of the screen with
links for each available tool (e.g., <strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>,
<strong><code>Discussion</code></strong>). The number of links will vary depending on which
tools were chosen for a site. Click the tool's name to go to the
corresponding tool.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong><code>Home</code></strong> on the menubar takes you to the homepage for the
site you're in. Homepages can contain a list of recent announcements,
recent discussion items, and selected resources.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>When you're using a tool, the reset button, which is located to
the left of the tool's name, will take you back to the first page of
that tool, and will reset the tool.
</li>
</ul>
