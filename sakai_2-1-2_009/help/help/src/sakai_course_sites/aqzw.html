<h2>In Sakai 2.0, from Worksite Setup, how do I
control access to my course or project site?
</h2>

<p>Using Worksite Setup, you can control access to your course or
project site by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>From the menubar in My Workspace, click

<strong><code>Worksite Setup</code></strong>, and then check the box next to the site that
you wish to revise.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although you can check multiple boxes, you
can only revise one site at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Revise</code></strong>, and then <strong><code>Site Access</code></strong>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Under "Site Status", choose whether or not to publish your site
(i.e., make it available to site participants).<br><br>
</li>

<li>For project sites only, under "Global Access", choose whether to keep
your site private, or to have it display in the directory and allow
sharing of files you select.<br><br>

</li>
<li>You can make your site broadly accessible by placing a checkmark
next to <strong><code>Can be joined by anyone with authorization to login</code></strong>,
and select a role for people who join your site. 
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Update</code></strong>.
</li>
</ol>
