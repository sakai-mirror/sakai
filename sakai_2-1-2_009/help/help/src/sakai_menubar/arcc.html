<h2>Sakai 2.0 Menubar: Overview
</h2>

<p>In a course or project site, the menubar is a customizable column
along the left of the screen that contains links to numerous
collaborative tools. Site maintainers have special permissions that
allow them to add, edit, and delete tools with the Worksite Setup or
Site Info tool. Therefore, the same tools will not appear in every
site.</p>

<p>The following tools can be added to the menubar:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Home:</strong> Clicking <strong><code>Home</code></strong> takes you to the
course or project site homepage. Homepages can contain a list of
recent announcements, recent discussion items, and selected resources.


<br><br> 
</li>
<li>
<strong>Schedule:</strong> Viewable in a calendar or list format,
the schedule can contain class session dates, deadlines, web
assignments dates, special events, cancellations, and other items of
interest.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Announcements:</strong> Use announcements to inform users
of changes in the schedule or policies of the class, as well as to
answer questions or make general comments.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Syllabus:</strong> Use this tool to create and display a
course syllabus, or have it point to a pre-existing online syllabus.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Resources:</strong> This function allows you to post
documents, electronic files, or URLs for users of a course
or project site.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Discussion:</strong> Use the discussion function to post
asynchronous conversations by topic or category.

<br><br> 
</li>
<li>
<strong>Assignments:</strong> You can assign several kinds of work
on the course or project sites. Your participants can submit
assignments electronically for grading and comments.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Drop Box:</strong> With this function, you have
the option to create individual Drop Boxes with private folders for
each student or other user's work.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Chat Room:</strong> Use chat for real time online
discussion with other worksite participants who are also logged into
the workspace. Chat is faster and more convenient than waiting for
information to post in the discussion area.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Email Archive:</strong> This is a repository for email
sent to the worksite email address.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Presentation:</strong> You
can present a slide show of images to many viewers at once, or have
them step through the show on their own.

<br><br> 
</li>
<li>
<strong>News:</strong> In the news section, you can read topical
news from online news sources.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Web Content:</strong> This tool allows you to view
specific web pages in the content area of the worksite.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Site Info:</strong> This section displays information
about the site for site participants.

<br><br> 
</li>
<li>
<strong>Help:</strong> You will find answers to some common
questions here.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Roles:</strong> Any site participant with a role of
"maintain" can modify the content of the site's menubar by adding or
subtracting tools using the Site Info tool.</p>

<p><strong>Adding tools:</strong> Your system administrator controls
which tools are available on your system. When new tools become
available, or users' needs change, your system administrator can add
tools to the system, and they will appear in the list of tools that
you can add to your site.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>If your system allows it, create a practice site so that site
participants can familiarize themselves with the tools, functions, and
options.<br><br>

</li>
<li>To avoid the accidental loss of resources, only grant a "maintain"
role to co-instructors, and others whom you can trust to maintain your
site. Everyone else should get an "access" role. For example, if
another participant removes the Syllabus tool from your site, it will
irreversibly remove the syllabus information that you stored there.
</li>
</ul>
