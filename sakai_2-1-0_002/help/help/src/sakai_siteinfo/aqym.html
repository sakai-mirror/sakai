<h2>Sakai 2.0 Site Info: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>The Site Info tool provides information about the worksite that you
are currently in. If you have a maintain role on the site, you can use
this tool to make changes to information about the site, tools
available in the site, and access to the site. You can also publish
the site using the Site Info tool.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Customizable:</strong> Site Info displays a participant list,
so that you can edit access to your site. It also displays a list of
tools available in the application, which you may add to or remove
from your worksite. You can alter your site's appearance and
description as well.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>The functions of the Site Info tool are also available through the
Worksite Setup tool, which is available on the menubar when
you are in My Workspace.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>If you do not have a maintain role, Site Info will show you only
the information about the worksite published by the maintainer.

</ul>
