<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I check a grade on an
assignment?
</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This may not be available in your implementation of this application.</p>


<p>To check your grade on an assignment, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>. When the
Assignments page appears, you'll see the the title of your assignment
and information about its status.

<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Click the title of the assignment for more details. You'll see
when your assignment was graded as well as the original
instructions. Your instructor may have added comments to the text that
you submitted; if so, these will appear underlined. If your instructor
left additional comments, they will be at the bottom of the page. You
may need to scroll down to see them.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Done</code></strong> to return to the Assignments main page.

<p>
You may need to take further action (for example, if your instructor
has made suggestions and asked you to resubmit the assignment). After
you've done the needed work, you can preview your changes, resubmit
your assignment, or save it as a draft.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
