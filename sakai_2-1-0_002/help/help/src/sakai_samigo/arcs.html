<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how can I
restrict access to my published assessments?
</h2>

<p>To restrict access to your published assessment, use the
"Assessment Released To" and "High Security" settings. Follow these
steps:
</p><ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click
<strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>. From the Assessments page, under "Published
Assessments", click <strong><code>Settings</code></strong> beneath the title of your
assessment.<br><br>
</li>

<li>From the scrolling list under "Assessment Released To", select the
users and/or groups to whom you want to release the
assignment.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Under "High Security", you can use one or both of the following
options:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>To restrict access to only certain computers on the
Internet, select <strong><code>Allow only specified IP
Addresses</code></strong>, and enter the IP addresses of those
computers.
</li>
<li>To require a secondary username and password, select <strong><code>Secondary
ID and Password</code></strong>, then fill in the "Username" and "Password"
fields.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> As soon as an assessment is published, its
author will receive its URL. It is up to the author to
distribute the assessment's URL to those taking the
assessment.</p>
