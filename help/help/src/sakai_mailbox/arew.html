<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I send mail to
    participants in my course or project site?
</h2>

<p>If you have access to a course or project site, you can
send mail to its Email Archive. (Some sites, depending on how their
owners have configured them, also accept mail from non-participants.)
Site members may choose to read the mail in the site's Email Archive,
or they may choose to have it forwarded to their own accounts.</p>

<p>To send an email message, you may use whatever email client
you wish. Simply address the email message to your site's address or
alias. You will find this address and/or alias stated in your site;
simply click <strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong> and look under "Email sent to the
following addresses will be archived and sent to participants:". Use
one of these addresses in the "To:" field of your email message.</p>
