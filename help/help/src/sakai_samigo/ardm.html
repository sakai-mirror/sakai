<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I create a new
assessment?
</h2>
<p>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp; Quizzes</code></strong>. 
From the Assessments page, you can create a new assessment from
scratch or by using a template. You
also can import an assessment by using the Import feature. Next to
Import assessment, click <strong><code>Import</code></strong>. Then, click
<strong><code>Browse...</code></strong>to select a file to import. (The maximum allowed
size of an imported file is 2MB.)</p>

<p>There are four basic steps to creating a new assessment:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#name">Name your assessment</a></li>
<li><a href="#settings">Configure the settings</a></li>
<li><a href="#sections">Create parts</a></li>
<li><a href="#questions">Create questions</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="name"></a><h4>Name your assessment</h4>

<p>In the New Assessment area, under "Create a new assessment", type a
title for your assessment in the "Title:" field, select a template if
you want, then click <strong><code>Create</code></strong>. This takes you to the editing
screen.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="settings"></a><h4>Configure the settings</h4>

<p>The <strong><code>Settings</code></strong> link, available from the Assessments page or
from the editing screen, allows you to specify various parameters for
the assessment (e.g., delivery dates and security settings).</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="sections"></a><h4>Create parts</h4>

<p>Every assessment must contain at least one part (i.e., section). Each
new assessment will include an automatically created part called
"Default". You can begin adding questions immediately to "Default", or
you can create your own parts.</p>

<p>To make a part, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the editing screen, click <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>. On the part
editing screen, in the "Part Title:" field, give the new part a name.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to save these settings and return to the
editing screen.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Once a part exists, you can remove it by clicking its <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>
button in the editing screen, or modify it by clicking
<strong><code>Modify</code></strong>. To change the order in which a part appears in your
assessment, change the number in the drop-down menu in the part's
title bar.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<a name="questions"></a><h4>Create questions</h4>

<p> You can either create a new question to add to the assessment, or you
can add a question from a Question Pool. To add your first question,
 first create an assessment, then from the drop-down menu next to "Add
Question:", choose the type of question to add. For more information
on question types, see "Creating questions for an assessment." Once
you've selected the type of question, the question editing screen
will open. To add a question from a Question pool, click the drop-
down menu next to Add Question and select "Copy from Question Pool."
</p>

<p>On the question editing screen, the available options will depend upon
the type of question you are adding. If you'd like to change the type
of question, you can choose another option from the "Change Question
Type" drop-down menu. Options common to most question types include:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Answer Point Value:</strong> Specify the point value for
each response in a question, or specify 0 (zero) for a survey or
ungraded question.


<p><strong>Note:</strong> The value you enter in the "Answer Point
Value:" field will determine the point value for each response within
a multiple correct question. If your question has two correct answers,
entering <code>10</code> in the "Answer Point Value:" field will make
each response worth 10 points and the entire question worth 20 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Question Text:</strong> State the actual question to be
asked.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Indicate the correct answer or
answers. You have the option to include feedback for specific
responses (item-level feedback).


<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Assign to Part:</strong> If you have created your
own parts, you may assign a question to any of those parts;
otherwise, it will be assigned to the default part.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Feedback (optional):</strong> Provide feedback for a
correct or incorrect response to the question (question-level
feedback).

<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Save:</strong> Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to add the question to
your assessment or to save any changes to the question.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cancel:</strong> Click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort the
question or changes and return to the editing screen.
</li>
</ul>

<p>After you insert a question into your new assessment, a drop-down
list, <strong><code>Insert New Question</code></strong>, will appear in the assessment
editing screen at the end of each part. Use this button to add a
question directly to a specific part. Near the top, within the
assessment's title bar, clicking <strong><code>Preview Assessment</code></strong> allows
you to preview the assessment as it presently stands. After you've
saved questions within your assessment, you can use the corresponding

<strong><code>Modify</code></strong> and <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> buttons to alter or delete
questions.</p>
