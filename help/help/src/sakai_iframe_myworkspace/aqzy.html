<h2>Sakai 2.0 My Workspace: Overview
</h2>


<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>My Workspace is an individual online worksite that functions as a
private workspace for each user. When you log in, you will
automatically open your My Workspace, which will display the Message
of the Day and My Workspace Information boxes. By default, these boxes
contain announcements and information from the system
administrator.</p>

<p>A site owner can revise what appears in the My Workspace
Information box by clicking <strong><code>Options</code></strong>. Only a system
administrator can modify the contents of the Message of the Day box,
but a site owner can click <strong><code>Options</code></strong> to customize how
announcements will display in the window.</p>
