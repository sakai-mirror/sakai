<h2>Sakai 2.0 Worksite Setup: Overview
</h2>
<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>The Worksite Setup tool provides information about the worksites that
you currently belong to or may join. If you have a maintain role on a
worksite, you can use this tool to make changes to information about
the site, tools available in the site, and access to the site. You can
also publish the site using the Worksite Setup tool.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>Worksite Setup displays a list of worksites to which you belong and/or
on which you can take some action, such as <strong><code>Revise</code></strong> or

<strong><code>Delete</code></strong>. If you lack maintain permission to a site, you cannot
edit it.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>The functions of the Worksite Setup tool mirror those of the Site
Info tool; Worksite Setup is available through My
Workspace, whereas Site Info is available in each worksite.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Without a maintain, in Worksite Setup you will only see the
information about the worksite published by the maintainer.
</li>
</ul>
