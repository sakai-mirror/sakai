<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, what happens if I click
the Back button in my browser?
</h2>
	  
<p>The application is designed to function independently of your
browser buttons. If you change your mind about a task, such
as posting a syllabus or a resource item, you need to rely on the
buttons within the application to cancel the action instead of your
browser's <strong><code>Back</code></strong> button.</p>

<p>
If you click the <strong><code>Back</code></strong> button before completing a task, then
the next time you try to use that tool you may return to the
uncompleted task; if this happens, you will need to click
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> before you can do anything else in that tool. 

</p>

<p>
You may also lock the tool so that it cannot be used by yourself or by
other people (i.e., other people with maintain roles for the
worksite). In that case, you can try to clear the lock by clicking the
reset button (the upward-pointing arrow in the upper left corner of
the tool). If this does not clear the lock, log out and wait at least
15 minutes before logging back in.
