<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how does the Email Archive
handle message formatting and attachments?
</h2>

<p>The Email Archive uses plain text to format messages, even if their
original format was HTML or rich text. If a message is sent
in a format other than plain text, site participants can view it in
its original format by clicking the link provided in the Email Archive
message.</p>

<p>The Email Archive also uses links to handle attachments. Instead of
receiving an attachment directly in the body of an email message, site
participants can click a link to view the attachment. This feature
helps prevent site participants from going over quota.</p>
