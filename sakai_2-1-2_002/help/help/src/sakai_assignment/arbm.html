<h2>In Sakai 2.0, how do I complete and submit an assignment?
</h2>
	  <p>Your instructor or project leader may set up assignments for you to
complete and submit online. To work on an assignment, follow these
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the site for the course or project with the assignment.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong>.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>Click the name of the assignment to open it.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The assignment must have a status of "open" for
you to be able to work on it.
</p>
</li>
<li>To work on the assignment, follow the instructions from your
instructor or project leader. You may need to type something into the
text box, or perhaps add an attachment, or both.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>To add an attachment, click the <strong><code>Add Attachments</code></strong> button in the
assignment window. In the window that appears, you have several
options:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>To attach a local file from your computer, click <strong><code>Local
File...&#160;</code></strong>. Type the filename in the box provided, or browse
for the file, select it, and click <strong><code>Attach</code></strong>. In the window that
appears, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.
</li>
<li>To attach a website URL, click <strong><code>Website URL...&#160;</code></strong>.
Type the URL in the box provided. You can omit the
<code>http://</code> (for example,
<code>www.google.com</code>). Then click <strong><code>Attach</code></strong>. In the
window that appears, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.

</li>
<li>To attach an item from the resources already in this course
website, click <strong><code>From Resources....&#160;</code></strong>. Choose the resource
you would like to add by clicking the box next to it, and click
<strong><code>Done</code></strong>. In the window that appears, click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
</li>
<li>If you'd like to see how your assignment will look to your
instructor or project leader, click <strong><code>Preview</code></strong>.

<br><br>

</li>
<li>If you want to save your assignment to complete later, click
<strong><code>Save Draft</code></strong> at the bottom of the screen. When you want to
reopen it, you'll find it listed in the assignment list with the word
"Draft" after it.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>To submit an assignment when you have finished, click the
<strong><code>Done</code></strong> button at the bottom of the screen.
</li>
</ol>
