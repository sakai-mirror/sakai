<h2>Sakai 2.0 News: Overview
</h2>

<h2>In Sakai 2.0, how do I add, edit, or delete
a news feed?
</h2>

<p>If you have the necessary permissions, you can set up a worksite to
display news. You must enter a URL for a RSS
news feed. An RSS feed is a specially formatted list of news
articles. Note that when you set up the site, or at a later time, you
can add more than one News tool.</p>


<h3>Adding a news feed</h3>
<p>To add a news feed, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>News</code></strong>.


<p>If you do not see <strong><code>News</code></strong> in your menubar, you will need to add
the news tool to your site. To do this, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>, then
<strong><code>Edit Tools</code></strong>. Check <strong><code>News</code></strong>, and then click
<strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>In the "Title" field, enter a title for the news feed that will
appear in the menubar.

<br><br>
</li>

<li>In the "URL" field, enter the URL for the news feed.

<p>If the worksite already contains news feeds or web content, you'll see
information about existing news and web items here. If there are no
blank fields at the bottom of the list to fill in, from the <strong><code>More
News Tools?</code></strong> drop-down menu, select how many news tools you'd like
to add.</p>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>. You will see a summary of your changes to
the site's tools.

<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>.
</li>

</ol>

<p>You should now see a link in the menubar to the news feed with the
title you provided.</p>


<h3>Editing a news feed</h3>

<p>To edit a news feed, in the menubar, click the title of the feed
you wish to edit (e.g., News, Google, Yahoo, or The New York
Times). Click <strong><code>Options</code></strong>, and then change the "Title" and "URL"
fields as you wish.</p>

<h3>Deleting a news feed</h3>

<p>To delete a news feed, in the menubar, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>, then
<strong><code>Edit Tools</code></strong>. From the list of tools, uncheck the news feed you
wish to delete, and then click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>. On the "Customize
Tools" screen, review your information, and then click
<strong><code>Continue</code></strong>. Click <strong><code>Finish</code></strong> to delete your feed.</p>

<p>Alternatively, in the "Customize Tools" screen, you can delete the
information in the "Title" and "URL" fields of the feed you wish to
remove. Click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong> and then <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>.</p>
