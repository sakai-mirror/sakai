<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I change the permissions for
a tool in a course or a project site?
</h2>
	  
<p>Permissions are granted for a tool rather than for
a particular item created by using a tool. For example, permissions
are set for the Announcement tool, rather than for individual
announcements.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Resources you can set
permissions for all resources, and you can also set permissions for
folders of resources.</p>

<p>To change permissions for a tool, follow the steps below.</p>

<ol>

<li>Open the site by clicking its tab.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In the menubar, click the tool for which you want to set
permissions.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong><code>Permissions...</code></strong> button along the top of the main
window.
<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>Check or uncheck the boxes to grant the permissions.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>. To change your selection, click
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must exit the permissions feature by
clicking <strong><code>Save</code></strong> or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> before you can set
permissions in another tool.</p>

<p>Each tool has a different set of available permissions. For a general
idea of the permissions available, see the list below of permissions
for the Announcements tool.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>new:</strong> Create a new announcement
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>read:</strong> Read an announcement
<br>

<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>revise.any:</strong> Revise any announcement after it has
been posted
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>revise.own:</strong> Revise only one's own announcements
after they have been posted
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>

<strong>delete.any:</strong> Delete any announcements after they
have been posted
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>delete.own:</strong> Delete only one's own announcements after
they have been posted
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>read.drafts:</strong> See drafts of announcements before
they are posted</li>
</ul>
