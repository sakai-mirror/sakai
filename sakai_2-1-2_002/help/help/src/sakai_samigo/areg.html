<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I move questions from
one part to another in my assessment?
</h2>

<p>In the menubar of the relevant course or project site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  </p>
<p>To move questions from one part to another in an assessment, on the
Assessments page, click the title of the assessment you wish to work
on. You'll see a list of questions for that assessment. For each
question you'd like to move to a different part, click
<strong><code>Modify</code></strong>. Then, from the "Assign to Part" drop-down list,
select the part in which you'd like that question to appear. For
example, if you'd like a question to be in the first part, select
<strong><code>1</code></strong>. Your questions will be automatically sorted into the new
part.</p>
