<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how can I customize my view of Discussion categories and topics?
</h2>

<p>When you click <strong><code>Discussion</code></strong> in the menubar, you will
see a list. Under each category, you'll see any topics and replies
that have been added. To view the categories and all the topics and
replies, click <strong><code>Expand All</code></strong>. To view just the categories,
click <strong><code>Collapse All</code></strong>.


</p><p>If a topic has replies, click the small paper stack icon to expand the
view so that a top-level item and all the replies below it are
visible.</p>

<h4>Layout options</h4>

<p>The Discussion tool uses two frames to display discussion topics and
replies. You can change the layout to a vertical (two-column) or
horizontal (two-row) layout by using the "View:" drop-down list. In
the <strong><code>Column Layout</code></strong>, the left frame shows the hierarchy of
categories, topics, and replies. Clicking a topic or reply shows the
content of the message in the right frame.</p>

<p>In the <strong><code>Row Layout</code></strong>, the top frame shows the hierarchy of
categories, topics, and replies; the content appears in the bottom
frame.</p>
