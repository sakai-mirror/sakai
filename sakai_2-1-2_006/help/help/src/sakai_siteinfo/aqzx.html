<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how can I see information
about my site?
</h2>

<p>In the menubar of a course site or project
site, you can click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong> to view information about
the site. If you have an access role for the site, you will see only
the information published by the site's maintainer. However, if you
have a maintain role, you will see a participant list as well as
buttons that allow you to edit that list and other site
information. </p>
