<h2>Sakai 2.0 Syllabus: Overview
</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The syllabus is the official outline for your course. As an
instructor, if you or your department has prepared an online syllabus
already, you can direct the Syllabus tool to link to it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can enter material to post directly to your
syllabus. As you create a syllabus, you can designate that it be
visible to the general public or just to members of your course.</p>

<p>Some features of a traditional syllabus are divided between the
Syllabus and Schedule tools. Some instructors use the Syllabus tool to
display the department's official online syllabus, and use the
Schedule as a detailed resource for students.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Content format:</strong> You can use the buttons at the top of
the editing window to format your content. The buttons supply any
needed HTML tags. You can toggle between viewing these HTML tags in
your content or not, and you may enter your own HTML tags instead of
relying on the buttons.
</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are multiple options for making web resources
available. Before you link to a web resource, consider whether it
would be better placed as a schedule item (such as a topic for the
week or a dated assignment), or as a resource in the Resources
section.  <br><br>
</li>
<li>If you'd like to insert an image, you must provide a URL for the
image. You can't upload or attach an image file to your syllabus.
