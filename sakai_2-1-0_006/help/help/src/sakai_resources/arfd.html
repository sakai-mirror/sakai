<h2>In Sakai 2.0, how can I see the metadata of a Resource?
</h2>

<p>When you look at a site's Resources, within the Resources window you
will see the Title, Size, Created By date, and Last Modified date.</p>

<p>If you have sufficient permissions, you can click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong> to
revise a Resource item, at which time you can also see Creation Time
and Last Modified By metadata.</p>

<p>To view a Resource folder's subfolders, click the arrow icon to the
left of the Resource title. You can toggle this arrow open (pointing
down; displays subfolders) and closed (pointing right; doesn't display
subfolders).</p>
