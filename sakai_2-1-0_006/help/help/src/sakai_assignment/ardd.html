<h2>Using Sakai 2.0, how do I return an
    assignment to a student?
</h2>
	  
<p>When you click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong> in the menubar, you
will see a list of assignments. The "In / New" column displays the
number of submissions that have come in from students (the "In" value)
and the number of new submissions (the "New" value) for each
assignment. These values let you know if you need to take action
regarding an assignment.</p>

<p>Detailed instructions for grading assignments, including information
on returning an assignment, are in the document Grading an assignment or reviewing student status. Note that once you have begun grading a student's
assignment, you can return the assignment to the student with or
without a grade. You can make comments both within the text submitted
by the student and within the additional comments text box. To allow
the student to resubmit the assignment, check <strong><code>Allow
Resubmission</code></strong>. When you are ready to return the assignment, click

<strong><code>Return</code></strong> at the bottom of the screen. In the "Submissions" list
for the assignment, under "Status", you will see the value "Return"
for the student in question.</p>
