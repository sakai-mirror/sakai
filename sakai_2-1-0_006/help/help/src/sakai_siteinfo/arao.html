<h2>In Sakai 2.0, how do I import material from
another site I own?
</h2>
	  
<p>You can choose to reuse material only from other sites that you
own. You can also combine material from more than one site. To do so,
follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the menubar of the relevant course site
or project site, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Click <strong><code>Import from Site</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Check the box(es) next to the site(s) that have material you
want to reuse, and then click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>Check the box(es) next to the material you want to reuse, and
click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>When they're imported, your materials are initially saved as
drafts, which means they are not immediately viewable by
participants. To make them viewable, you must post them.
