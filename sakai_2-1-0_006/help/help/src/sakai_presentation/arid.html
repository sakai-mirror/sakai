<h2>Sakai 2.0 Presentation: Overview
</h2>
	  <h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Presentation tool allows you to present a set of slides to many
viewers. As the presenter, you can move forward and backward through
the slides, and viewers (using the Join mode) will follow each move
within a few seconds.
</p><p>Viewers also can switch to View mode, and navigate through the
slides independently of the presenter. Viewers can switch back to Join
mode to rejoin the show at any time.
</p><h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Join mode:</strong> This mode allows viewers to follow
along as you, the presenter, move forward and backward through your
presentation.</p>

<p><strong>View mode:</strong> This mode allows viewers to move
through your presentation independently.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple presenters:</strong> Any user who has write access
to the folder in Resources that contains the presentation can act as
presenter.
</p><h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul>
<li>While watching a presentation, it may take up to 10 seconds for
viewers to see the new slide after the presenter advances the
slide.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Viewers can refresh manually to see the latest slide if the
automatic advance seems to be taking too long.<br><br>

</li>
<li>The Presentation tool can handle any web-displayable image file,
including .gif, .png, and .jpg.
</li>
</ul>
