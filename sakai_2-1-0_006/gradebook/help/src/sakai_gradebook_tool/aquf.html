<h2>Viewing and exporting student roster from the Gradebook</h2>

<h4>Viewing your roster</h4>
<p>To view your student roster from the Gradebook, follow these
steps</p>

<ol>

<li>At the top of the Gradebook, click the <strong><code>Roster</code></strong> link.

<br><br>
</li>
<li>You will see a list of students  whom you are authorized to grade,
their scores on all graded assignments, and their cumulative
scores. You can search for a particular student by name or ID.  If your course has defined sections or groups whose members you are authorized to grade, you will be able to filter the roster to display those sections or groups one at a time. If
your course does not have any students enrolled yet, you will see the
error message "No students have been added to this course".

<br>
<br>

</li>
<li>When you are finished viewing your roster, click the
<strong><code>Overview</code></strong> link to return to the main Gradebook menu.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Exporting your roster</h4>

<ol>
<li>To export your roster to Microsoft Excel (<code>.csv</code>
format), click the <strong><code>Export for Excel</code></strong> or the <strong><code>Export
CSV</code></strong> button.


<br><br>
</li>
<li>The default filename format for your exported roster is

<code>gradebook_[courseID]_assignment_name_date.*</code>. The exported
fields and the names of the Excel column headers are "Student Name",
"Student ID", and "[assignment name]". The full student display names and
complete assignment names are exported. Assignment point values will
only export up to two decimal places. Scores are listed in the
assignment name column.

<p>All available class data is exported. If you sort or filter your
roster by your student names before exporting, it will not affect the
output.
