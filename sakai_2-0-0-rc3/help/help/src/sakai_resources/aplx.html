<p><strong>Note:</strong> Instead of creating a new resource and moving
it to a specific folder, you can open a folder (click the folder's
name) and create the resource from within the folder.</p>

<p>To move an existing resource:

  can move more than one resource at a time.)  <br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>
</li><li>Click <strong>Cut</strong>.
<br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>
</li><li>Open the folder where you would like to copy the resource by
clicking its name. (You must click the name of the folder, not the
black arrow for expansion.)

<br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>
</li><li>Click <strong>Paste</strong> to move the resource.</li></ol>
