<h2>Membership: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>The Membership tool in My Workspace is where you can
join and unjoin available worksites.
</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Sites:</strong> On the Membership tool page, you'll see a
list of all the worksites to which you belong. This includes sites you
have joined, and sites that you have been added to as a participant by
the creator of the site. You'll also see a list of all the sites that
you can join, but haven't yet.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>By default, you will receive email notification about
announcements, email, and resources that are posted to worksites to
which you belong.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>You can change your preferences so that you receive this
notification as a daily digest, or you can block these messages
entirely.
</li>
</ul>
