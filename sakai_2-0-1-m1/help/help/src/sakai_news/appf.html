You can use RSS to view
news.  RSS is a data format that is used to syndicate news on the
web. It allows users to view continuously updated content from a news
site in another website.
</p>

<p>
Sites that distribute news in RSS format are called "news feeds." The
Sakai News tool is an RSS "news aggregator" (or "news reader") that
reads and displays content from RSS news feeds. In addition to news,
some websites use the RSS format for information that is updated
often, such as blogs (web logs that serve as publicly accessible
personal journals), events listings, or the revision history of a
book. You can usually identify an RSS feed URL by the
.rss or .xml in the URL (e.g.,
http://www.csmonitor.com/rss/scitech.rss or
http://www.umich.edu/news/news.xml).
</p>

<p>RSS is an application of XML, a markup language for creating web
documents.</p>

<p>
If you are a site owner, you can customize your News
feature by putting in a web address for any RSS news feed. You can
find many feeds by searching Google for RSS feeds in your area of
interest.
