<p>The following is an overview of the Announcements feature.</p>

<h3>What they do</h3>

<p>Announcements are used to inform site participants of current items of
interest. Announcements can have multiple attachments, such as
documents or URLs. Site owners and instructors can choose
to have an announcement automatically emailed to all of the site
participants by using the "required" or "high" notification setting.</p>


<p>To see the Announcements from all the sites to which you belong, in
the menubar of My Workspace, click <strong>Announcements</strong>.</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>

announcement, use "required" or "high" notification to make sure the
announcement is emailed to them. This means all site participants will
receive the announcement in email as well as seeing it on the site.
