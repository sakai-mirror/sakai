/**
 * This is the externally exposed API of the gradebook application.
 *
 * The Gradebook project has three types of programmatic clients.
 *
 * 1. The framework. This manages the application, performing various
 * administrative functions which aren't handled by the application itself,
 * including creating and removing gradebooks.
 *
 * 2. External assessment engines. These use the Gradebook as a passive
 * mirror of their own assignments and scores. Gradebook users will thus
 * be able to see those assignments alongside Gradebook-managed assignments,
 * and combine them when calculating a course grade. The Gradebook application
 * itself will not change the externally-managed assignments and scores.
 *
 * 3. Clients of application services -- that is, clients who want to "act
 * like the Gradebook would" to automate what would normally be done in the UI.
 *
 * Currently all three clients are served by this single interface. The Gradebook
 * team plans to split the interface by client type in a future release.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING</b>: Because the Gradebook project team is not responsible
 * for defining the first two types of client, the Gradebook service
 * does not attempt to guess at their authorization needs. Our administrative
 * and external-assessment methods simply follow orders and assume that the caller
 * has taken the responsibility of "doing the right thing." DO NOT wrap these
 * methods in an open web service!
 * <p>
 * The behave-like-the-application service methods DO mimic normal Gradebook
 * authorization as part of mimicking normal Gradebook behavior. These methods
 * may throw security exceptions. Call the service's authorization-check methods
 * if you want to avoid them.
