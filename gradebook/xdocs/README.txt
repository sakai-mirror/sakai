*DANGER* WORK IN PROGRESS!
==========================

The Gradebook is currently in transition to fully support Section Awareness.
The standalone build is changing. Documentation has not yet been updated to match.

For the bravest among you, here's how to build and populate a standalone Gradebook as of right now:

# Start in the "sections" module, not the "gradebook" module.
cd ../sections

# Build Section Management, Section Awareness, and integration support.
maven -Dstandalone=true -Dhibernate.properties.dir=C:/java/sakai-trunk/sakai/gradebook/tool/src/hibernate cln bld
# Initialize your local database with the sections tables.
maven -Dstandalone=true -Dmem=false -Dhibernate.properties.dir=C:/java/sakai-trunk/sakai/gradebook/tool/src/hibernate schema

# Go back to the Gradebook.
cd ../gradebook/
# Regular standalone build.
maven -Dstandalone=true cln bld
# Populate your local database with test Section Awareness data and Gradebook data.
# (This step could be combined with the one above if you like.)
maven -Dstandalone=true load-full

Where are you?

The xdocs directory contains user-generated documentation. Javadocs and test
reports generated by maven are located in target/docs


Building the gradebook standalone
---------------------------------

0) You'll need to build Sakai in order to generate some jars on which the standalone
gradebook depends. Start at the top sakai directory and run "maven sakai".

1) Edit gradebook/tool/project.properties to match your build environment.

2) Make sure that the sakaigb database (or whatever you want to called it in
your hibernate.properties file) has been created.

3) Running 'maven -Dstandalone=true cln bld' from the top level project directory
(currently /sakai/gradebook/ in svn) will clean, compile, run the tests, and
deploy the webapp.

4) If you want, you can then set up the database and load it with test data
by changing to the 'tool' subdirectory and running 'maven load-full'.


Looking at the gradebook
------------------------

With the default settings, deployed to a default test Tomcat server, you can
point your browser to:

http://localhost:8080/sakai-gradebook-tool/

Pick a role to play and go from there.


Running Additional Tests
------------------------

Thes unit tests live in the "tool" subproject, but they rely on other gradebook
subprojects (namely service, component, and component-data), so you
should make sure that the entire project has been built before running the tests.
If you've made any modifications to files outside of the tool subproject, you'll
need to do a full gradebook build prior to running the goals listed below.

* Export and execute the database schema (from /gradebook/tool):
'maven schema'

Note: The ddl is saved in /gradebook/tool/target/schema/

* Recreate the database and populate it with a set of pre-defined gradebooks (from /gradebook/tool):
'maven load-full'

If you want to only create some gradebooks and assignments (without any users or grades):
'maven load-gradebooks'

* Recreate the database, populate it with test data, and run business logic
tests (from /gradebook/gb/tool):
maven load-full test-standalone
