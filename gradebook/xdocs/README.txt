Building the gradebook standalone
---------------------------------

0) You'll need to build Sakai in order to generate some jars on which the standalone
gradebook depends. Start at the top sakai directory and run "maven sakai".

1) Edit gradebook/tool/project.properties to match your build environment.

2) Make sure that the sakaigb database (or whatever you want to called it in
your hibernate.properties file) has been created.

3) Running 'maven -Dstandalone=true cln bld' from the top level project directory
(currently /sakai/gradebook/ in svn) will clean, compile, run the tests, and
deploy the webapp.

4) If you want, you can then set up the database and load it with test data
by changing to the 'tool' subdirectory and running 'maven load-full'.


Looking at the gradebook
------------------------

With the default settings, deployed to a default test Tomcat server, you can
point your browser to:

http://localhost:8080/sakai-gradebook-tool/

Pick a role to play and go from there.


Running Additional Tests
------------------------

Thes unit tests live in the "tool" subproject, but they rely on other gradebook
subprojects (namely service, component, and component-data), so you
should make sure that the entire project has been built before running the tests.
If you've made any modifications to files outside of the tool subproject, you'll
need to do a full gradebook build prior to running the goals listed below.

* Export and execute the database schema (from /gradebook/tool):
'maven schema'

Note: The ddl is saved in /gradebook/tool/target/schema/

* Recreate the database and populate it with a set of pre-defined gradebooks (from /gradebook/tool):
'maven load-full'

If you want to only create some gradebooks and assignments (without any users or grades):
'maven load-gradebooks'

* Recreate the database, populate it with test data, and run business logic
tests (from /gradebook/gb/tool):
maven load-full test-standalone
