<h1>Baseline Gradebook UI Components</h1>
<h3>by Ray Davis - 16 February</h3>

<p>Each top item in the list names a page area that seems as if it might work
as an entity outside any single page, or that seems to require
something that normal JSF can't handle. (I don't bother to list UI elements that are only associated by CSS class, text resource, or normal JSF
tags.) I briefly list each item's subcomponents and likely runtime
parameters, note what I've found in the way of existing documentation
or support, and suggest what to do about it.</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>AppMenu</strong> : TaskTextLinks + (optional) CurrentTask
<ul>
<li>Style Guide – This <em>may</em> be the "Intra-tool Navigation" (with navIntraTool CSS class) listed in the table of contents of the 1.3 document, but it's hard to tell since that section is blank.<br>
</li>
<li>Samigo – Implemented in-line on each page rather than as include-fragment or component. CVS includes a Navigation Map tag, but it doesn't seem to support a "current selection" argument.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>APPROACH</strong>
<ol>
<li>Suggest for Style Guide.<br>
</li>
<li>Start with a JSP 2 tag. (The
AppMenu + Title at the top of each page looks pretty Tiles-like, but
right now I don't see enough payback from Tiles given our small number
of pages and the otherwise wide variation between them.)<br>
</li>
<li>Possibly move to JSF tag later.
(MyFaces HtmlPanelNavigation shows an approach for applications in
which the user will always be in a menu context: Define AppMenu as a
collection of HtmlCommandLink components. When a command link is
activated, its "broadcast(event)" method deactivates other child
command links and sets its own status to active. The command link's
active state then determines its rendering. In the Baseline Gradebook,
however, not all task pages appear in the AppMenu. Assignment Grades,
Course Grades, Edit Assignment, Remove Assignment, and Student View are
all reached in other ways.)<br>
<br />
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>PageContent</strong> : Title + Subtitle + Instructions + Messages + PageSpecific
<ul>
<li><strong>APPROACH</strong>
<ol>
<li>All
of these (except Title, Message, and "PageSpecific") are optional,
which is one reason I'm iffy about going to Tiles just to consolidate
them. It might be worth using JSP inclusion
to set the page content structure and class defintions up, or, given
the small number of pages, we might just copy-and-paste as needed.<br>
<br />
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Messages</strong> : Passed from backing bean to next page; thrown away once displayed.
<ul>
<li><strong>APPROACH</strong>
<ol>
<li>Check MyFaces standard JSF Message
support to see whether we can use it directly, can build on it (as with
the Pilot renderer), or have to roll our own message bean in session
scope.<br>
<br />
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>PagingTable</strong> : SearchFilter + PagingControls + SortableTable
<ul>
<li>Style Guide – Included as "List", except that instead of a search filter there's an unlikely sounding "View" dropdown menu.<br>
</li>
<li>Samigo – A Pager tag is in CVS, but I haven't seen it in action in the demos. Unknown amount of work needed.<br>
</li>
<li>MyFaces – Provides similar functionality with a
combination of two tags: an extended dataTable and a dataScroller that
refers to it. No automatic support for range selection menu, search
filtering, or table summary. Unknown amount of work to make the format
match our wireframes—facets are used for the controls.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>APPROACH</strong>
<ol>
<li>Suggest changes to Style Guide.<br>
</li>
<li>The application UI will start with non-paging tables. Tag options can be investigated in parallel.<br>
</li>
<li>Compare our requirements to Samigo and try to get a tag that will support us both.<br>
</li>
<li>Depending on Samigo tag schedule, check basic paging
workflow with the MyFaces control and search filtering workflow with a
separate input area.<br>
<br />
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>PagingControls</strong> : BeginningButton + PreviousButton + RangeSelect + NextButton + EndButton + CurrentRange
<ul>
<li>Style Guide – Described (and improved in 1.3) as "List Navigator".<br>
</li>
<li>MyFaces – dataScroller tag.<br>
<br />
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>ItemDetail</strong> : DetailNavigation + DetailDescription
<ul>
<li>Style Guide – Describes this as an "Item Summary page". I doubt it can be turned into a single component.<br>
<br />
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>DetailNavigation</strong> : Previous + ReturnTo + Next
<ul>
<li>Style Guide – Describes this as a "List Navigator".<br>
</li>
<li><strong>APPROACH</strong>
<ol>
<li>Since
we only have one page that needs this, just embed the logic in that
page. It should be made into a standard tag later for use by other
tools.<br>
<br />
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>SortableTable</strong>
: Headers + CellComponents (usually text or numbers, input field for
points) + SortColumn + SortDirection + ColumnSortingComparison
(case-insensitive alphabetic; numeric; date; boolean; special [e.g.,
"Final Grade" always appears as if it has the latest due date, even
after undated assignments]) + DynamicallyDefinedColumns (needed when
the columns are assignments); optionally one more column than headers <ul>
<li>Style Guide – Describes this as a "List" or an
"Actionable List" depending on whether all cells are readonly or not.
Unspecified support for column sorting comparisons, dynamically defined
columns, and dangling columns. Paging position after sort changes or
range changes is unspecified.<br>
</li>
<li>Samigo – The basic functionality has started to show up,
with some bugs and limitations, but doesn't seem to be componentized
yet. Instead, each sortable header is specified in the JSP as a separate commandLink in a panelGroup.<br>
</li>
<li>MyFaces – Provides similar functionality with an extended
dataTable and commandSortHeader tags. Need further research to find out
support for multiple sorting comparisons (might need to do it by
subclassing cell values to implement the Comparable interface) and
dynamically defined columns.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>APPROACH</strong>
<ol>
<li>Suggest additions to Style Guide.<br>
</li>
<li>The current Samigo approach is very bulky. Try to componetize the functionality, using MyFaces (and maybe Oracle ADF) as inspiration, including our "advanced" requirements.<br>
</li>
<li>Depending on tag implementation schedule, we may build on the MyFaces components to test basic workflow.<br>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>WARNING</strong> – Given the difficulty of building complex dynamic components in JSF and the difficulty of building on existing JSF
renderers, this is where we're most likely to fail to deliver even the
reduced functionality of the baseline Sakai 2.0 gradebook. If, as seems
possible to me, we're unable to satisfy all requirements within the
schedule, I'm afraid that some usability and functionality will have to
be unpredictably sacrificed to our choice of presentation framework. I
also worry that we might not be able to make a JSP 2 implementation coexist peacefully with the JSF
lifecycle; at any rate, by the time we feel forced to try that step, it
would probably be too late to implement it. (I may look for a suitable JSP 2 tag, just in case.)<br>
<br />
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>DateSelect</strong> : OptionalCheckbox (could be implemented as a different component in same form area) + MonthDayYearSelect + CalendarSelectPopup
<ul>
<li>Style Guide – Describes this as "Date/Time Entry".<br>
</li>
<li>Samigo – Has a DatePicker tag.<br>
</li>
<li>MyFaces – Has inputDate and inputCalendar tags.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>APPROACH</strong>
<ol>
<li>Start with the Samigo DatePicker. If we have problems (unlikely), we can temporarily fall back to the MyFaces tag.</li>
</li>
