<h2>Exporting scores from the Gradebook</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this document,
you need to be assigned a role that has the necessary permissions.</p>

<p>From the Gradebook, you can export your students' scores to a
Microsoft Excel file by their cumulative score for the course and with
the student roster. To export scores from the Gradebook, in the
relevant course site, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong> from the
menubar, and then follow the appropriate steps below.</p>

<h4>Export cumulative scores</h4>

<p>Under the list of assignments, click the <strong><code>Course Grade</code></strong>
link. You will see a course summary with an average score for your
entire class and your grading table. To export your course scores to
Microsoft Excel (<code>.xls</code>) or <code>.csv</code> format, click
the <strong><code>Export for Excel</code></strong> or the <strong><code>Export CSV</code></strong> button.</p>

<p>The default filename format for your file is
<code>course_grade_[courseID]__date.*</code>. The exported fields and
the names of the Excel column headers are "Student Name", "Student
ID", and "CourseGrade". The full student display names and complete
assignment names are exported. Assignment point values will only
export up to two decimal places. Scores are listed in the assignment
name column.</p>

<h4>Export scores from the student roster</h4>

<p>At the top of the Gradebook, click the <strong><code>Roster</code></strong> link. To export
your roster (including student grades) to Microsoft Excel
(<code>.xls</code>) or <code>.csv</code> format, click the <strong><code>Export
for Excel</code></strong> or the <strong><code>Export CSV</code></strong> button (located near the
bottom of the page). For more information about exporting scores from
the student roster, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzg">Viewing and exporting student roster from the Gradebook</a>.</p>
